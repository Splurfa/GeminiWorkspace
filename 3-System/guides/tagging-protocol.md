# Tagging Protocol: Your Cross-Cutting Organization System

This protocol outlines the principles and best practices for applying tags across your notes. Tags are a flexible, cross-cutting organizational tool that enable smart folder organization, rapid retrieval, and provide context across your notes, regardless of their physical location.

## I. Tagging Principles

*   **Consistency is Key:** While new tags can be added, ensure they adhere to these principles and are applied consistently.
*   **Lowercase:** All tags must be in **lowercase**.
*   **Stacked Tags:** Use stacked tags to combine independent concepts (e.g., `#business #strategy #client`).
*   **No Redundancy:** If a concept can be expressed by combining two or more single-word tags (e.g., `#business #strategy`), do NOT create a single kebab-cased tag for it (e.g., do NOT use `#business-strategy`).
*   **Strict Kebab-Case:** For multi-word individual tags, use **kebab-case** *only when the phrase is two words and represents a single, indivisible entity (e.g., a proper noun, a specific system name) that requires it for clarity or established naming conventions*. Examples include specific project names or tool names like `#common-thread` or `#note-taking`.

## II. Approved Tag Hierarchy (Examples and Guidelines)

This hierarchy maps conceptual categories (which are *not* tags themselves) to examples of actual, approved tags you should use in your notes. This list is not exhaustive; new tags can be added as needed, provided they adhere to the Tagging Principles.

*   **Personal**
    *   `#personal` (General tag for personal notes)
    *   `#health`
        *   `#fitness`
        *   `#mindfulness`
        *   `#nutrition`
    *   `#finance`
        *   `#budgeting`
        *   `#income`
        *   `#investing`

        *   `#process`
    *   `#sales`
    *   `#strategy`
        *   `#growth`
        *   `#marketing`

*   **Project**
    *   `#project` (General tag for project-related notes)
    *   *Specific Project Tags (use kebab-case for two-word project names, e.g., proper nouns):*
        *   `#bx-os`
        *   `#common-thread`

*   **System**
    *   `#system` (General tag for system-related notes)
    *   `#protocol`
        *   `#note-taking`
        *   `#tagging`
    *   `#template`
        *   `#daily-note`
        *   `#meeting-note`
    *   `#workflow`
        *   `#discovery`
        *   `#synthesis`

*   **Library**
    *   `#library` (General tag for library/resource notes)
    *   `#framework`
        *   `#eisenhower`
        *   `#para`
    *   `#prompt`
        *   `#creative-thinking`
    *   `#reference`
        *   `#article`
        *   `#book`
        *   `#video`

*   **Tooling**
    *   `#tooling` (General tag for tools/technology notes)
    *   `#ai`
        *   `#automation`
        *   `#llm`
    *   `#hardware`
    *   `#software`
        *   `#gemini-cli`
        *   `#obsidian`

## III. Tagging Specific Note Types

### Daily Notes

Daily notes are designed for capturing and processing daily inputs. They should primarily use tags that reflect the *content* or *themes* discussed, rather than acting as a primary organizational hub for projects.

*   **Focus:** Use tags to categorize the topics, meetings, or insights from that specific day.
*   **Examples:** `#meeting`, `#insight`, `#task`, `#reflection`, and relevant content tags from the hierarchy above (e.g., `#business`, `#personal`, `#strategy`).
*   **Avoid:** Over-tagging with project-specific tags unless the daily note is *primarily* about a single project's progress. Link to project notes for detailed project context.

### Project Notes

Project notes (e.g., Project Manifests, specific project-related research) are the primary location for project-specific tags.

*   **Focus:** Use the specific project tag (e.g., `#common-thread`, `#bx-os`) and other relevant tags that describe the project's nature, phase, or key areas.
*   **Examples:** `#project #common-thread #strategy #marketing`, `#project #bx-os #system #protocol`.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure the primary project tag is consistently applied to all notes directly related to that project.

## IV. Tag Management & Evolution

*   **Adding New Tags:** If you identify a need for a new tag not currently in this protocol, ensure it adheres to the "Tagging Principles" (Section I). Once used, consider adding it to the "Approved Tag Hierarchy" as an example if it represents a recurring concept.
*   **Deprecation/Migration:** If an old tag needs to be deprecated, it will be noted here, and a simple strategy (e.g., search and replace) will be suggested for migration in existing notes.
