# Workspace Context: Your Gemini CLI Home Base

This document serves as a persistent memory and central guide for your Gemini CLI workspace. It outlines key facts, conventions, and the overarching context for how this environment is structured and operated.

## I. Workspace Purpose

This Gemini CLI workspace is designed as a permanent home base for your sessions. Its primary purpose is to help organize projects, guide tool choices, and facilitate the building and previewing of your work. It acts as your central hub for managing information and tasks.

## II. Core Operating Principles

*   **User as Decider, AI as Processor:** You, the user, are the strategist and final decision-maker. My role as the AI is to act as a simple, on-demand text processor, executing commands precisely and delivering raw output for you to control.
*   **Consistency & Convention:** Adherence to established conventions (e.g., naming, tagging, folder structure) is paramount for efficient organization and retrieval.
*   **Modularity & Clarity:** Information is organized into distinct, linked protocol documents to ensure clarity and easy reference.

## III. People & Collaborators

*   **Zach:** A key collaborator. (Note: Spell his name "Zach", not "Zack").

## IV. Active Projects

*   **The Common Thread:** The name of the consulting agency.
*   **Bx OS:** A pilot project being developed for Hillel Hebrew Academy.

## V. Workspace Structure

This workspace is organized into a clear, top-level directory structure to facilitate logical separation and efficient management of your notes and resources:

*   `0-Inbox/`: A temporary holding area for new, unprocessed information and raw inputs.
*   `1-Notes/`: The primary location for your active notes, thoughts, and processed information.
*   `2-Library/`: Contains reference materials, prompts, and curated resources.
*   `3-System/`: Houses guides, protocols, session logs, and system-level configurations for the workspace itself.
*   `4-Archive/`: For completed projects, old notes, and historical data that is no longer actively used but needs to be retained.

## VI. Note-Taking & Tools

*   **Primary Note-Taking Environment:** Your notes are primarily managed within the **local file system of this Gemini CLI workspace**, utilizing Markdown for content.
*   **Gemini CLI:** This command-line interface is your primary tool for interacting with, managing, and processing information within the workspace.
*   **Tagging System:** You rely on stacking atomic tags (e.g., `#client #acmecorp`) for filtering, organization, and cross-referencing notes.
