# Meeting Summary Generation Protocol

## 1. Purpose

This protocol outlines the automated workflow for generating static HTML meeting summaries from a source transcript.

## 2. Workflow Overview

This process combines a source transcript with an HTML template and data generated by parallel LLM prompts to produce a final, formatted HTML summary.

## 3. Inputs

*   **Source Transcript:** A Markdown file containing the meeting transcript, placed in the `0-Inbox/assistant/` directory.
    *   Example: `0-Inbox/assistant/Bx OS Stakeholder Meeting.md`

## 4. Processing Steps

Upon receiving a command to generate a meeting summary (e.g., `create meeting summary for [entity] from [transcript_filename]`), the following steps are executed:

1.  **Read Transcript:** The specified source transcript is read from `0-Inbox/assistant/`.
2.  **Data Generation (LLM Integration - Future Phase):**
    *   The transcript is processed using two parallel LLM prompts to extract structured data:
        *   **Executive Summary:** Using the logic from `2-Library/prompts/40-idea-organization-prompt.md` (Idea Organization Prompt).
        *   **Conversation Flow:** Using the logic from `2-Library/prompts/41-chat-transcript-synthesis.md` (Chat Transcript Synthesis Prompt).
    *   *(Note: For initial testing, this data is simulated/hardcoded within the `generation_script.js`.)*
3.  **HTML Generation:**
    *   The `generation_template.html` (located in `portal/_template_test/generation_template.html`) is read.
    *   The generated data is used to populate the template's placeholders.
    *   This process is managed by `generation_script.js` (located in `portal/_template_test/generation_script.js`).
4.  **Output HTML Creation:** A final HTML file is generated.

## 5. Output & Deployment

*   **Output File:** The generated HTML summary (e.g., `test_summary_output.html` for testing, or `YYYY-MM-DD-[meeting-topic].html` for production) is created. The filename is derived from the source transcript.
*   **Deployment:** The generated HTML file is committed to the appropriate location within the `portal` repository (e.g., `portal/[entity]/meetings/`). This deployment follows the [[github-sync-protocol]].

## 6. Command Structure

The command to initiate this workflow is:
`create meeting summary for [company|derek|zach] from [transcript_filename]`
