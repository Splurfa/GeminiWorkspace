# Captain's Log - 20250805-02-workspace-refinement

## Session Summary: Workspace Refinement & Documentation Update

This session focused on significant improvements to the workspace's documentation and organizational protocols.

### Key Activities:

*   **Daily Note Update (2025-08-05):**
    *   Integrated synthesized context from "article context.txt" into the Nate Jones article section.
    *   Added a detailed synthesis of the "Personal Board of Directors" meeting (2025-08-04) to the daily note.
*   **Tagging Protocol Refactoring:**
    *   Created a new, dedicated `tagging-protocol.md` document in `3-System/guides/`.
    *   Updated `note-template-protocol.md` to remove the detailed tagging section and instead reference the new `tagging-protocol.md`.
*   **Workspace Context Enhancement:**
    *   Significantly beefed up `workspace-context.md` in `3-System/guides/`. This document now serves as a comprehensive central guide, detailing the workspace's purpose, core operating principles, structure, note-taking environment, and links to all key protocols.
*   **README File Synchronization:**
    *   Updated `GEMINI.md`, `1-Notes/README.md`, and `3-System/README.md` to reflect the new documentation structure, ensuring all relevant `README` files direct users to the appropriate protocol and context documents.
*   **Prompt Library Update:**
    *   Optimized the transcript synthesis prompt.
    *   Categorized and moved the prompt to `2-Library/prompts/analysis-synthesis/conversation-synthesis.md`.
    *   Updated `prompts-index.md` to reflect the new prompt and category.
*   **Prompt Library Reorganization:**
    *   Implemented a flat, sequentially numbered structure for all prompts in `2-Library/prompts/`.
    *   Updated `prompts-index.md` to reflect the new flat structure and list all 41 prompts.
    *   Updated `2-Library/prompts/README.md` to direct users to `prompts-index.md`.

### Outcome:

The workspace's documentation is now more organized, consistent, and user-friendly, with clear separation of concerns for note templates, tagging, and overall workspace context. This provides a more robust foundation for future work.
