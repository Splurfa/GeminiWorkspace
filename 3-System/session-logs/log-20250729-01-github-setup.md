Session focused on enabling the `gh repo list` command.

### Key Events:
- **Goal:** Enable the Gemini session to list all of the user's GitHub repositories.
- **Authentication:** Established a baseline SSH connection to GitHub for `git` operations.
- **Action:** Guided the user through installing Homebrew and the GitHub CLI (`gh`).
- **Blocker:** Discovered that the interactive `gh auth login` process does not share credentials with the non-interactive Gemini session due to security sandboxing.
- **Decision:** The current plan is to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) that can be explicitly passed to the Gemini session to authenticate the `gh` command.
- **Next Step:** Guide the user through creating a PAT on the GitHub website with the necessary `repo` scope.
