# Log: 2025-07-28 - Initial Workspace Setup

**Objective:** To design and implement a hybrid human/machine-friendly file structure for our collaboration.

**Initial Plan:**
- Create a 5-folder system: `inbox`, `projects`, `library`, `system`, `archive`.

**Deviations/Forks (Approved):**
1.  **Fork 1:** Added `0-training-ground/` for dedicated AI training sessions.
2.  **Fork 2:** Added `system/personas/` to define and store different operational modes for me.
3.  **Fork 3:** Refined the large file handling strategy by creating `library/reference-materials/` for storage and `0-training-ground/training-syllabi/` for pointing to training data.
4.  **Fork 4 (This Log):** Added `system/session-logs/` to maintain a persistent record of our tasks and decisions.

**Outcome:** The full folder structure, including all READMEs and this first log, was created successfully. The workspace is now ready for our first training session.
