# Settings

**Purpose:** This folder is intended to store configuration files, preferences, or other settings that influence the behavior of your workspace or specific tools within it.

## Expected Content:

*   **Tool-specific configurations:** Settings for external tools or integrations.
*   **User preferences:** Custom preferences that might not fit into `GEMINI.md`.
*   **Environment variables:** (Though typically managed elsewhere, could be documented here if relevant).

This helps centralize and document how various aspects of your workspace are configured.
