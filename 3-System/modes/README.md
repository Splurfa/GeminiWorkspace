# Modes

**Purpose:** This folder contains the definition files for different operational modes and personas for me, your Gemini assistant.

## How to Activate a Mode/Persona:
1.  To activate a mode or persona, say: "Activate the `[mode-name]` mode." (e.g., "Activate the `prompt-engineer` mode.")
2.  I will then read the corresponding `.md` file and follow its instructions.

## How to Deactivate a Mode/Persona:
1.  To return to my default state, use the command: "Deactivate mode."
