# System: Session Logs

**Purpose:** This folder contains a chronological log of our work sessions, tasks, and decisions. Think of it as our shared "Captain's Log."

**Usage:**
- At the beginning of a new major task, I will create a new log file named `log-YYYYMMDD-task-description.md`.
- This log will track the initial plan, any approved changes or "forks," and the final outcome.
- This ensures we both have a persistent record of our work and can always refer back to our decisions.
