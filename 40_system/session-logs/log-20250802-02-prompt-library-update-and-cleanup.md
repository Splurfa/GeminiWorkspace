# Session Log: 2025-08-02 - Prompt Library Update and Cleanup

## 1. Session Overview

*   **Date:** 2025-08-02
*   **Primary Persona:** Default
*   **Working Directory:** /Users/splurfa/Documents/GeminiWorkspace/
*   **Initiated Agent/Stack:** Default instance
*   **Relational Connections:** Continuation of prompt library metadata task, and new tasks for folder cleanup and new prompt integration.
*   **Tags:** #prompt-library #metadata #cleanup #file-organization #inbox #stacks

## 2. Key Outcomes & Decisions

*   **Achievements:**
    *   Successfully added YAML metadata to prompts 30 through 39, ensuring consistent formatting and including `id`, `source`, `description`, `tags`, and `date_added` fields.
    *   Corrected metadata for prompts 30 and 31 to align with the established format.
    *   Cleaned up the `10_stacks/sandbox` directory by deleting duplicate prompt files (`34-planning-canvas.md`, `35-visual-design.md`, `36-database-schema.md`).
    *   Updated `10_stacks/sandbox/engineer.md` to correctly reference the full paths of the prompts in the `30_library/prompts` directory.
    *   Integrated a new prompt, `idea-organization-prompt.md`, from the inbox into the `30_library/prompts/writing-communication/` directory, renaming it to `40-idea-organization-prompt.md` and adding appropriate metadata.

## 3. Detailed Session Breakdown

### Prompt Library Metadata Addition
Continued the task of adding YAML metadata to the prompt library. This involved processing prompts from number 30 to 39. The metadata included `id`, `source`, `description`, `tags`, and `date_added` fields, ensuring consistency with previously processed prompts.

### Metadata Correction for Prompts 30 and 31
Identified and corrected an error in the metadata format for prompts 30 and 31, specifically regarding the inclusion of a `tags` property and overall structural alignment with prompts 1-29.

### Stacks Folder Cleanup and Update
Reviewed the `10_stacks` folder and its `sandbox` subdirectory. Determined that `34-planning-canvas.md`, `35-visual-design.md`, and `36-database-schema.md` were duplicate files of prompts already in the `30_library/prompts` directory. These duplicate files were deleted. The `engineer.md` file within `10_stacks/sandbox` was updated to reference the correct, full paths of the prompts in the `30_library/prompts` directory.

### Inbox Prompt Integration
Processed a new prompt, `idea-organization-prompt.md`, from the `00_inbox/Notes/` directory. After clarifying the source of the prompt (Nate Jones), appropriate metadata was added, and the file was moved to `30_library/prompts/writing-communication/` and renamed to `40-idea-organization-prompt.md`.
