## 28. Future Regret Minimizer

### Your Input

**Decision I'm Facing:**
Should I commit significant time, energy, and capital to building the "ABA Rail" business, or should I focus on more immediate, less risky consulting opportunities for Common Thread?

**Option A:**
Go all-in on building ABA Rail. This involves finding a design partner, building an MVP, navigating the complex healthcare compliance landscape, and attempting to create a new category of software in the ABA space.

**Option B:**
Do not build ABA Rail at this time. Focus instead on growing the Common Thread consulting business through established, lower-risk client work.

**Time Horizon:**
Looking back in 10 years.

**What's at Stake:**
*   **Financial:** Significant capital investment vs. stable consulting income.
*   **Career:** The opportunity to build a scalable, high-growth product company vs. growing a successful consulting firm.
*   **Impact:** The potential to solve a major workflow problem for an entire industry vs. delivering value on a client-by-client basis.
*   **Time/Energy:** The intense, all-consuming nature of a startup vs. a more predictable consulting workload.

**Current Age:**

**Current Life Context:**
[Please fill in any relevant life circumstances - e.g., financial situation, family commitments, personal risk tolerance]
