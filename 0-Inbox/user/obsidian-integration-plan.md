### **Plan: Preparing Your GeminiWorkspace for Obsidian**

The goal is to transform your `GeminiWorkspace` into a fully functional Obsidian vault, where all your existing content, links, and tags are recognized and leveraged by Obsidian's features (like Graph View, backlinks, and tag pane).

#### **Phase 1: Understanding Obsidian's Core Conventions**

Before making any changes, we need to confirm Obsidian's specific requirements for optimal performance.

1.  **Internal Links (Wikilinks):** Obsidian primarily uses `[[Note Name]]` for internal links. It's flexible with paths (e.g., `[[Folder/Note Name]]`) and can often resolve links without the `.md` extension.
2.  **Tags:** Obsidian tags start with `#` and can be single words (e.g., `#tag`) or contain hyphens for multi-word tags (e.g., `#multi-word-tag`). They generally cannot contain spaces. Your existing `tagging-protocol.md` already aligns well with this.
3.  **Metadata (Frontmatter):** Obsidian strongly leverages YAML frontmatter at the very top of a note for structured metadata. This is where properties like `tags:`, `aliases:`, `date:`, and custom fields are typically stored. Your current notes do not explicitly use YAML frontmatter, which is a key area for improvement.
4.  **Folder Structure:** Obsidian works seamlessly with nested folder structures, which your `GeminiWorkspace` already utilizes effectively.
5.  **Filenames:** While Obsidian is quite forgiving, using clean, consistent filenames (e.g., kebab-case or spaces, but avoiding special characters) is best practice.

#### **Phase 2: Comprehensive Workspace Audit & Discrepancy Identification**

I will perform a detailed analysis of your entire `GeminiWorkspace` to identify all instances of links, tags, and potential metadata, and compare them against Obsidian's conventions.

1.  **Scan for All Files:** I will use `glob` to list all `.md` files in your workspace.
2.  **Analyze Internal Links:** For each `.md` file, I will read its content and identify all internal links (e.g., `[[...]]`). I will check if they consistently use the Wikilink format and if the paths are resolvable within Obsidian's context.
3.  **Analyze Tags:** I will extract all tags (`#tag`) from all `.md` files and verify their format against Obsidian's rules (e.g., no spaces, valid characters). I will cross-reference them with your `tagging-protocol.md` to ensure consistency.
4.  **Identify Potential Metadata:** I will look for patterns in your notes that could be extracted and formalized into YAML frontmatter (e.g., dates, sources, key takeaways that are consistently formatted).
5.  **Review Filenames:** I will check filenames for any characters that might cause issues in Obsidian or across different operating systems.

#### **Phase 3: Proposed Remediation Steps**

Based on the audit, I will propose specific actions to make your workspace Obsidian-compatible.

1.  **Implement YAML Frontmatter:**
    *   **Action:** For all `.md` files, I will propose adding a YAML frontmatter block at the very top.
    *   **Content:** This block will include:
        *   `tags:`: All existing tags from the note will be moved here, formatted as a YAML list (e.g., `tags: [strategy, system, bx-os]`).
        *   `aliases:`: If a note has common alternative names, these can be added here to improve link recognition.
        *   `date:`: The creation or last modification date of the note.
    *   **Template Update:** I will update your `daily-note-template.md` and any other relevant templates to include a default YAML frontmatter block, ensuring future notes are created with this structure.

2.  **Standardize Internal Links:**
    *   **Action:** I will ensure all internal links are in the `[[Note Name]]` or `[[Path/To/Note Name]]` format. If any links currently include the `.md` extension (e.g., `[[Note Name.md]]`), I will propose removing them for cleaner display in Obsidian, as Obsidian typically handles this automatically.
    *   **Verification:** Obsidian's "Unresolved Links" pane will be a key tool here.

3.  **Validate Tag Formatting:**
    *   **Action:** I will ensure all tags strictly adhere to the `#tag` or `#kebab-case-tag` format, as per your `tagging-protocol.md` and Obsidian's requirements. Any tags with spaces or invalid characters will be flagged for correction.

4.  **Filename Review:**
    *   **Action:** I will recommend any necessary filename adjustments (e.g., replacing problematic characters, ensuring consistency in spacing or kebab-case if desired).

#### **Phase 4: Verification Strategy**

After implementing the proposed changes, you will need to verify the compatibility.

1.  **Create a Test Vault:** I will instruct you to create a *copy* of your `GeminiWorkspace` and open this copy as a new vault in Obsidian. This ensures your original workspace remains untouched.
2.  **Obsidian Feature Check:**
    *   **Graph View:** Check if the Graph View accurately reflects the connections between your notes.
    *   **Tag Pane:** Verify that all your tags appear correctly in the Tag Pane and that clicking them filters notes as expected.
    *   **Backlinks Pane:** Open a few notes and check if the Backlinks pane correctly identifies all notes linking to them.
    *   **Search:** Perform searches for keywords and tags to ensure content is easily discoverable.
    *   **Unresolved Links:** Check Obsidian's "Unresolved Links" pane to identify any links that Obsidian couldn't find.

This comprehensive plan will ensure your `GeminiWorkspace` is fully optimized for use with Obsidian, allowing you to leverage its powerful features for knowledge management.
