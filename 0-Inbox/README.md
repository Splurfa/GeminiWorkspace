# 00_inbox

This folder serves as the primary communication hub for file exchange between the user and the AI assistant, and as a temporary staging area for other unprocessed information.

## Communication Lanes (User <-> Assistant):

*   **`user/`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Your dedicated inbox for placing any files, documents, or specific requests that you want the AI assistant to process, synthesize, or act upon.
    *   **Flow:** You write here; the AI assistant reads and processes from here.

*   **`assistant/`:**
    *   **Purpose:** The AI assistant's dedicated inbox for delivering processed output, synthesized content, or files for your review and action.
    *   **Flow:** The AI assistant writes here; you read and act upon content from here.

## Other Inbox Contents:

*   **`notes/`:** Contains your daily notes and other note-related subfolders. This area is for your personal note organization and is distinct from the user/assistant communication lanes.
*   **General Files:** Any other new, unprocessed files or ideas that do not fit into the `user/` or `assistant/` lanes can be temporarily stored directly in the `00_inbox/` root. Its contents should be reviewed and moved to other locations regularly.

Raw source materials intended for synthesis can be logged directly into the 'Raw Sources for Synthesis' section of your daily note, or stored here if they are larger files requiring later processing.
