# Completed Projects

**Purpose:** This folder serves as an archive for projects that have been completed, are no longer active, or have reached a defined end-state. 

Archiving projects here helps to:
*   Keep the main `1-Notes/projects/` directory clean and focused on active work.
*   Preserve a historical record of past efforts for future reference or review.
*   Ensure that all project-related files are retained in an organized manner.
