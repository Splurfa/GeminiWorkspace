### **Step 1: Situation Briefing**

"Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. I've hit a critical roadblock with a Supabase bug in my first app, which has forced me to question my entire technical strategy. I need to decide on a minimal, repeatable tool stack that not only gets this first product shipped but also provides a reliable system for future projects, ensuring I don't get stuck in this '80/20 gap' again."

### **Step 2: Individual Board Member Perspectives**

**Anya, the Pragmatic Engineer**
*   ***Her Unique Lens:*** Focuses on the long-term viability and technical integrity of the tools being used.
*   ***Key Questions She'd Ask:***
    *   "Can you show me the exact bug? Is it a documented issue with Supabase or Lovable, or is it a symptom of a flaw in your application's logic design?"
    *   "What does your data schema look like? Are you accidentally creating performance issues or logical conflicts that the no-code tool is hiding from you?"
*   ***Her Advice:*** "Don't blame the tool until you've proven it's the tool's fault. A pivot is expensive. Let's spend two hours diagnosing the root cause. If it's a fundamental platform limitation, we pivot. If it's a logic error, we fix it and build a better process for designing logic in the future."
*   ***What She'd Prioritize:*** Technical correctness and root cause analysis.
*   ***Red Flag She'd Raise:*** Building on a shaky foundation. Making a strategic decision based on a single, poorly understood tactical problem.

**Marcus, the Systems-Driven Founder**
*   ***His Unique Lens:*** Views every problem as an opportunity to build a better system.
*   ***Key Questions He'd Ask:***
    *   "This Supabase bug isn't the real problem; it's just the first symptom. What is your standard operating procedure for when you hit a technical wall? Who do you call, what's the budget, and what's the decision tree for 'fix' vs. 'rebuild'?"
    *   "How are you tracking project health across your portfolio? A single blocked project shouldn't halt all progress. Where is the system that allows you to park one project and advance another?"
*   ***His Advice:*** "Stop trying to fix the car and start designing the factory. This isn't about one app; it's about your capacity to produce dozens of them. Document a clear '80/20 Gap Protocol' right nowâ€”that's your most valuable asset."
*   ***What He'd Prioritize:*** Creating a repeatable, scalable process for development and portfolio management.
*   ***Red Flag He'd Raise:*** One-off solutions. Solving this problem in a way that doesn't create a reusable asset for the next one.

**Isabelle, the No-Code Agency Builder**
*   ***Her Unique Lens:*** Finds the most direct and resource-efficient path to a shipped, valuable product.
*   ***Key Questions She'd Ask:***
    *   "Does the kiosk queue feature that's blocked *truly* need to be in the first version of the Hillel app? Can we ship a valuable MVP without it and add it later?"
    *   "Why Lovable? For a simple app and a website, have you considered a more integrated, mainstream stack like Webflow and Wized, or even just Glide? It might be worth a one-day spike to see if you can rebuild the core functionality faster than you can fix this bug."
*   ***Her Advice:*** "Time is your most expensive resource. Don't get bogged down in a technical swamp for a feature that might not be critical. De-scope the MVP to get it into users' hands this week, or pivot to a tool that's better suited for speed and simplicity."
*   ***What She'd Prioritize:*** Speed to market and ruthless prioritization of the MVP feature set.
*   ***Red Flag She'd Raise:*** Sunk cost fallacy. Wasting weeks trying to fix a bug in a non-standard tool when a faster, more reliable path exists.

### **Step 3: Board Discussion Synthesis**

**Where They'd Unanimously Agree:**

*   **Point 1:** The immediate bug is a symptom of a larger, more important strategic problem.
*   **Point 2:** A formal, documented process is necessary to handle these situations in the future.
*   **Core principle:** Don't make a major strategic decision (pivoting your entire stack) without more data.

**Where They'd Debate:**

*   **Tension Point 1: The Value of the Current Tool**
    *   **Anya** would argue: "We must understand the tool's limits before abandoning it. The knowledge gained from a deep diagnosis is a valuable asset."
    *   While **Isabelle** would counter: "That knowledge is only valuable if you stick with the tool. Why spend days becoming the world's leading expert on a niche tool's bug when you can ship on a mainstream platform tomorrow?"
    *   **Resolution path:** A time-boxed investigation. Spend no more than one full day diagnosing the bug, as Anya suggests. If it's not solved by then, follow Isabelle's advice and spike a rebuild on an alternative platform.

*   **Tension Point 2: The First Asset to Build**
    *   **Marcus** would argue: "The first priority is the '80/20 Gap Protocol.' The process is more important than the product right now."
    *   While **Isabelle** would counter: "The first priority is shipping the Hillel app. A happy client and a real-world case study are the only assets that matter for generating momentum and revenue."
    *   **Resolution path:** Do both. Create a "v0.1" of the protocol *by* applying it to the immediate problem of the Hillel app. The process is built and refined through the act of shipping.

**The Surprising Alliance:** **Anya (the Engineer)** and **Isabelle (the Agency Builder)** would both emphasize that the specific tool choice is less important than the user's fluency with it. Both would agree that a "good enough" tool that you know inside and out is better than a "perfect" tool that constantly trips you up.

### **Step 4: Board's Official Recommendation**

**Majority Position:** The board, led by Anya and Marcus, recommends a "diagnose and document" approach. The goal is not just to fix the bug but to use it as a case study to build your first "Standard Operating Procedure."

**Dissenting Opinion:** Isabelle would file a minority report arguing this is over-engineering the problem. She'd state: "Your goal is to ship a product and a website this week. The fastest path is to de-scope the feature or switch to a simpler tool like Glide or Webflow. Don't build a factory when you've been asked to deliver a car."

**Conditions & Milestones:** The board agrees you should proceed with the majority position if:

1.  You can time-box the initial diagnosis of the Supabase bug to no more than 4-6 hours of focused work.
2.  You can find at least one viable, alternative no-code stack (e.g., Webflow/Wized, Glide) where you could plausibly rebuild the core app features in under two days.
3.  You can answer this question: Is the kiosk queue feature a "must-have" for the initial launch, or a "nice-to-have" that can be added in V2?

**Success Metrics:** The board would measure success by:

*   **Short-term (3 months):** The Hillel app is live and in use, and the Common Thread website is published. You have a documented "80/20 Gap Protocol v1.0".
*   **Medium-term (1 year):** You have successfully launched a second small project using your protocol, and you have a clear system for managing your project portfolio.
*   **Long-term (3+ years):** Your "factory" is producing a steady stream of small, impactful, and profitable projects with minimal friction.

### **Step 5: Personal Decision Framework**

**Whose Voice Resonates Most:** Marcus's voice resonates most because his "build a factory, not just a car" mindset directly addresses my core challenge. The bug is temporary; the lack of a system is the real, recurring risk. His approach promises long-term capability, not just a short-term fix.

**What to Incorporate:**

*   **From Anya:** The discipline of a time-boxed "root cause analysis." I will not allow myself to get stuck in an indefinite bug-hunt.
*   **From Marcus:** The core idea of immediately drafting a "v0.1" of my '80/20 Gap Protocol' as I solve this problem. The solution must be a reusable process.
*   **From Isabelle:** The pragmatism of ruthlessly de-scoping. I will seriously question the necessity of the blocking feature for the MVP.

**What to Respectfully Decline:**

*   **Isabelle's** suggestion to immediately pivot tools. While I will research alternatives as a backup plan, abandoning the current stack without understanding *why* it failed feels like a missed learning opportunity.
*   **Anya's** potential desire for a perfect, deep technical diagnosis. I am not an engineer. A "good enough" diagnosis that tells me whether the tool or my logic is the problem is sufficient for me to make a strategic choice.

**My Integration Plan:** Combining the board's wisdom, I will:

1.  **Time-box the Diagnosis (Anya's Tactic):** Spend four hours trying to identify the root cause of the Supabase bug. Is it the tool or my logic?
2.  **De-scope or Document (Isabelle's Pragmatism):** Based on the diagnosis, I will either a) remove the feature for the MVP or b) if the fix is simple, I'll implement it.
3.  **Draft the Protocol (Marcus's System):** As I go through steps 1 and 2, I will document every step, decision, and resource used. This document becomes the "80/20 Gap Protocol v0.1," my primary deliverable from this entire exercise.

### **Step 6: Ongoing Advisory Relationship**

**Regular Check-ins:** I'll revisit this board when:

*   I successfully ship the Hillel app MVP.
*   I am about to select the technical stack for the next project.
*   In 90 days, to review the success of the "factory" system.

**Questions for Next Meeting:**

1.  My "80/20 Gap Protocol" is now battle-tested. How can we refine it to be more efficient and robust for the next build?
2.  I'm managing two active projects and one in discovery. What's a simple, visual system for managing this portfolio and communicating status to stakeholders?

**Board Evolution:** Consider adding a **Financial Strategist** when projects begin to generate meaningful revenue, to help optimize pricing, costs, and portfolio investment. Consider rotating out Isabelle if my work shifts from client-facing MVPs to more complex, internal-facing systems, as her "speed-to-market" lens might become less critical than Marcus's long-term systems thinking.
