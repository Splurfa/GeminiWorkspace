### Personal Life Audit & Action Plan

This document outlines key personal challenges, immediate priorities, and long-term goals across health, home, and financial stability, emphasizing the need for structured planning
and consistent action.

#### 1. Immediate Financial & Health Challenges

*   **Dental Work:** Urgent need for extensive dental work, currently unfeasible due to state disability income.
*   **Fixed Income:** Operating on a fixed income for the next 9 weeks, requiring a strategy for sustainable growth.
*   **Vehicle Need:** Lacks a personal vehicle; obtaining one is contingent on securing income.

#### 2. Household & Shared Responsibilities

*   **House Maintenance:** Critical need to list and manage all categories of house and personal household maintenance for me and my best friend Zach, who are trying to raise his daughter
    Sophie in our house.
*   **Cat Hair Management:**
    *   Regular cleaning of curtains with a brush.
    *   Daily cat brushing.
    *   Acquisition of air filters (specific brand known, plan for filtration system in place, but requires budget).
*   **Household Budgeting:** Need to plan a budget to manage shared resources with Zach.
*   **Essential Items:** Identify immediate needs for the house that offer maximum impact for minimal input.

#### 3. Personal Health & Well-being

*   **Exercise Routine:** Develop a small, basic exercise routine focusing on no-excuse activities:
    *   Push-ups.
    *   Shooting hoops regularly.
    *   Daily dog walks around the block.
*   **Physical Condition:** Acknowledges being out of shape despite physical appearance, impacting self-perception.
*   **Nutrition:** Incorporate daily smoothies (Vitamix) and meal planning as part of a broader health and preventative measure, extending beyond dental health.
*   **Long-Term Health:** At 42, a focus on precautionary measures is essential.

#### 4. Asset Management & Financial Planning

*   **RV in Limbo:** An out-of-state RV is in repo status and requires immediate attention to untangle the situation.
    *   Ensure RV storage lot payments are current (Selma Storage, Oregon).
    *   Verify and update RV registration (under Zach's name).
*   **Milestone Dates:** Identify and track regularly recurring financial obligations (e.g., Sophie's insurance, tuition not covered by paycheck).
*   **Vehicle Strategy:** Plan for car registration costs and consider selling Zach's older car, which is nearing its last viable resale value.

#### 5. Interdependencies & Future Outlook

*   **Income Dependency:** All personal and household stability is contingent on securing a stable income, primarily through the consulting business.
*   **Relationships:** Acknowledges the importance of building and mending relationships, but prioritizes other immediate concerns for later.
