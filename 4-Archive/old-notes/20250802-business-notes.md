### Business and AI Consulting Venture: From Idea to Action

This document outlines the foundational ideas, challenges, and strategic next steps for launching a solo or partnered AI consulting business, focusing on niche development and
operational execution.

#### 1. Venture Concept & Niche Identification

*   **Core Idea:** Establish a solo consulting business, potentially partnered with my friend Zach, under the agency name "The Common Thread."
*   **Niche Strategy:** Focus on AI consulting for non-technical individuals and businesses, leveraging Nate Jones' advice to specialize in application and strategy rather than technical
    coding. This addresses my non-coder background.
*   **Origin:** Inspired by successful AI application for Ashley Calzada (Stellar Steps), leading to the realization of broader business potential.

#### 2. Partnership Dynamics & Skill Synergy

*   **Zach's Role:** Zach brings valuable connections and "intangible skills" (soft skills, BCBA background) that complement the technical and operational aspects.
*   **Venn Diagram Analogy:**
    *   **Circle 1 (Zach):** Human-centric skills, strong connections, but lacks operational/technical understanding.
    *   **Circle 2 (Me):** Strategic, technical, and human synthesis; covers Zach's operational deficiencies.
    *   **Missing Circle 3:** A third element is needed to cover my technical deficiencies, allowing me to remain in the strategic middle.
*   **Collaboration Goal:** Ensure stability and proper deployment of ideas by having strong "bookends" for technical and human aspects.

#### 3. Strategic Approach & Pilot Projects

*   **Immediate Need:** Frame and package the consulting agency idea, including example projects as pilots or works in progress.
*   **Target Client:** Approach "Danny" (Zach's connection, number two at a company managing BCBAs) with the packaged proposal.
*   **Potential Partnership:** Danny expressed interest in seed money and collaboration after seeing an app example.
*   **Current Pilot Project:** Developing a behavior tracking application (Behavioral OS) for Zach's school, Hillel Hebrew Academy, as an alpha/beta pilot.
    *   **Timeline:** Needs to be finished within a week.

#### 4. Personal Development & Tooling Challenges

*   **Prompt Engineering:** Actively building prompt engineering knowledge and creating a prompt library, managed via Google Gemini CLI to populate a file system for prompts and stacks.
*   **Coding Landscape for Non-Coders:** Exploring Nate Jones' Substack articles for techniques to understand coding components and functions without direct coding. This is a high
    priority.
*   **Tool Stack Experimentation:**
    *   **Mem.ai:** Experimenting for central synthesis.
    *   **Gemini CLI:** Utilizing for file system population and structure from inputs.
    *   **Wispr Flow:** Used for voice dictation to improve pace and speed.
    *   **Lovable (Current Challenge):**
        *   **Issue:** Potentially prohibitively expensive and too complex ("too much going on under the hood").
        *   **Evaluation Need:** Requires help to determine if it's the right tool.
        *   **Past Experience:** Previous attempts to build projects in Lovable were inefficient (400 message credits for 80-90% completion), possibly due to improper engagement with its
            assistant.
        *   **Assistant Limitations:** The Lovable assistant, running an LLM instance, exhibited "context bleed, drift, mirroring, and glazing," leading to assumed fixes and potential
            hallucinations.

#### 5. Next Steps & Action Items

*   Develop a clear package/framing for the consulting agency.
*   Prepare example projects (e.g., the behavioral app) as pilots.
*   Approach Danny with the proposal.
*   Prioritize studying Nate Jones' Substack articles on coding for non-coders.
*   Evaluate the suitability of "Lovable" for ongoing development.
*   Refine the overall tool stack for efficiency and clarity.
