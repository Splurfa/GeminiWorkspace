# Old Notes

**Purpose:** This folder is designated for notes that are no longer actively used, have been superseded by newer information, or are simply being archived for historical purposes.

Archiving old notes here helps to:
*   Keep your active notes directories (`1-Notes/`) focused and uncluttered.
*   Retain a record of past thoughts, research, or ideas that might be useful for future reference.
*   Maintain an organized system for your personal and business knowledge base over time.
