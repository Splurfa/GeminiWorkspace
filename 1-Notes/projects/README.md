This directory organizes your projects by domain, providing a structured overview of all active and archived project efforts.

## Project Domains:

*   **business/:** Contains projects related to your business ventures, consulting, and professional development.
*   **music/:** Contains projects related to your music endeavors.
*   **personal/:** Contains projects related to your personal life, health, and household.

## Understanding & Managing Projects:

Each project within these domains has its own dedicated folder and is managed through a [project-name]-manifest.md file. For detailed guidance on project manifests and project management, refer to the [[project-manifest-protocol]].

## Starting a New Project:

1.  **Choose Domain:** Navigate to the appropriate domain folder (e.g., business/, music/, personal/).
2.  **Create Project Folder:** Create a new dedicated folder for your project within the chosen domain (e.g., 1-Notes/projects/business/your-new-project-name/).
3.  **Create Project Manifest:** Inside this new folder, create a project manifest file named [project-name]-manifest.md.
4.  **Populate Manifest:** Populate this manifest file following the guidelines in the [[project-manifest-protocol]].
