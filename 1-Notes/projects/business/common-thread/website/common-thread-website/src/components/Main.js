        <h2>Solving Real Problems, One Step at a Time</h2>
        <p>We don’t show up with pre-built answers.</p>
        <p>We start by listening, observing, and identifying the specific friction points that disrupt workflows and slow progress.</p>
        <p>By solving what matters most — first — we generate immediate value and build momentum.</p>
        <p>Each solution becomes a modular building block that fits into a larger, smarter system.</p>
        <p><strong>What sets us apart:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>📏 Clear metrics.</li>
          <li>🔍 Transparent outcomes.</li>
          <li>🤝 Trust earned through results — not promises.</li>
