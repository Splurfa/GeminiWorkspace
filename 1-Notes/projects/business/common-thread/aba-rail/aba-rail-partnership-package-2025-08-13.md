# The ABA Rail Opportunity

**The US ABA therapy market is valued at over $10 billion, yet providers can lose up to 15% of revenue due to billing errors and denied claims—a $1.5 billion problem caused by broken workflows.**

But that $1.5 billion isn't just a number. It's a story of wasted time, frustrated staff, and delayed care. It's the story of a thousand small leaks that threaten to sink the entire ship. It's the story of a broken system.

## The Story: A Tale of Leaky Pipes

### Act I: The World of Leaky Pipes

Meet "Sarah," the director of a mid-sized ABA clinic. She's passionate about providing care, but she spends her weekends chasing down paperwork and fighting with insurance companies over denied claims. Her clinic uses a patchwork of disconnected software for notes, billing, and compliance. Data is entered multiple times, errors are common, and her best therapists are burning out on administrative tasks.

The stakes are high. Sarah's clinic is losing money, her staff is demoralized, and she's worried they can't scale to meet the needs of families on their waitlist.

The inciting incident comes when a major payer denies a whole month of claims for one of her key clients due to a "documentation error," putting her clinic in a cash-flow crisis. She realizes the "small leaks" are about to sink the ship.

### Act II: The Search for a New System

Sarah tries to fix the problem by buying yet another piece of software—a "smarter" billing tool. But it doesn't solve the root cause: the data coming into it is still a mess. The leaks continue.

She looks for an all-in-one system, but they are clunky, expensive, and not designed for the specific, stage-gated workflow of ABA. They are generic EMRs, not purpose-built "workflow rails."

Her dark moment comes when she concludes that no solution exists. She feels trapped, facing the choice of either hiring more and more admin staff (killing her margins) or accepting that revenue leakage and staff burnout are just the cost of doing business.

Then, she has a conversation with a colleague who sketches out an idea on a napkin: *"What if we didn't need another tool? What if we had a rail? A system that starts at the point of care and guides the data, step-by-step, all the way to a paid claim, with all the rules built-in."* This is the "aha!" moment.

### Act III: Installing the Modern Plumbing

This is where ABA Rail comes in. It’s not another tool; it’s the rail. It starts with a simple mobile app for the therapist, ensuring data is clean from the first mile.

The platform automatically routes the session notes for supervisor approval, links it to the correct authorization, and generates a perfect, payer-ready packet. Sarah's clinic implements the pilot.

Within 90 days, their denial rate drops by 80%. Staff spend 10 fewer hours per week on paperwork. Cash flow is predictable. Sarah can finally focus on expanding care, not plugging leaks. With this ground-truth rail in place, they can now add scheduling, analytics, and parent portals—all built on a foundation of clean, reliable data. The whole system works.

## The Solution: ABA Rail

ABA Rail is a unified, stage-gated workflow platform purpose‑built for ABA. It creates a single, connected pathway from the start of a session to the moment a claim is paid.

-   **For providers:** Fewer denied claims, faster payments, less admin overhead.
-   **For payers:** Standardized packets, reduced retro‑auth requests, clear medical necessity evidence.
-   **For staff:** Simple, mobile‑first tools that make data capture and approvals quick and accurate.

By owning the first-mile data capture and creating a trusted, payer-friendly pipeline, ABA Rail will become the default operational infrastructure for the ABA industry.

## The Ask

You recognize the pattern of a massive industry hobbled by broken, legacy workflows. Sarah's story isn't unique; it's the norm. And that presents a clear and massive opportunity.

**We are seeking a strategic partner to help us capture this market. We are raising a pre-seed round of $750,000 to finalize our MVP and onboard our first three design-partner clinics.**

The next step is a follow-up meeting next week to walk you through our detailed financial model and product roadmap. We are looking to close this round in the next 60 days.

Imagine a world where every ABA provider operates on a single, trusted rail. Where payers and providers work in partnership, not opposition. This isn't just a software company; it's the opportunity to build the fundamental infrastructure for an entire industry.

Every day, the industry loses over $4 million to these solvable problems. We have the team, the plan, and the unfair advantage of a payer-first design.

**The time to build the rails is now.**
