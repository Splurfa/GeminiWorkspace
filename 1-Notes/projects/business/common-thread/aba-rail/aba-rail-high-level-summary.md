# ABA Rail High-Level Summary

#summary #strategy

**The Problem**
ABA providers juggle multiple disconnected tools for session notes, clinical review, insurance authorizations, and billing. This leads to delays, denied claims, and wasted staff time. The weakest link is the “first mile” — when behavior techs capture data on site. If that step is messy or incomplete, every stage after suffers.

**The Solution**
ABA Rail is a streamlined, end‑to‑end workflow system built specifically for ABA. It captures accurate data at the point of care, moves it through each stage of clinical review, prepares exactly what payers require, and hands it directly to billing — all with built‑in audit trails.

**Why It Matters**
- **For providers:** Fewer denied claims, faster payments, less admin overhead.
- **For payers:** Standardized packets, reduced retro‑auth requests, clear medical necessity evidence.
- **For staff:** Simple, mobile‑first tools that make data capture and approvals quick and accurate.

**How It Works**
1. Behavior tech starts and ends sessions with one tap, entering required notes and goal data.
2. Supervisors review and approve packets, linked to authorizations and treatment plans.
3. The system auto‑generates insurer‑ready packets for pre‑auths and updates.
4. Approved sessions flow straight into billing, cutting down on rework and delays.

**Go‑to‑Market**
We will launch with design‑partner clinics and target insurers as allies, proving measurable ROI in faster approvals and fewer denials. The long‑term vision is to set the standard for ABA data and documentation workflows nationwide.

**The Opportunity**
By owning the first‑mile capture and building a trusted, payer‑friendly pipeline, ABA Rail can become the default operating rail for the industry — solving a costly problem at scale.
