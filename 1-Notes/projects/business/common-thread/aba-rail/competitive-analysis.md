# ABA Rail Competitive Analysis

## Your Input
Competitors to Analyze:
	•	CentralReach
	•	Rethink Behavioral Health
	•	TheraNest
	•	AccuPoint
	•	Noteable
Feature/Flow Focus: The end-to-end workflow from session creation to billing, specifically:
	1	Session Capture: How behavior techs (RBTs) capture session data, notes, and signatures.
	2	Clinical Review: How supervisors (BCBAs) review and approve session notes.
	3	Authorization Management: How remaining units and expiration dates are tracked.
	4	Payer Packet Generation: Whether the system automatically creates compliant packets for pre-authorizations and claims.
	5	Billing Integration: How approved sessions are handed off to the billing/RCM process.
Our Current Approach: "ABA Rail" is a new concept designed to replace the current fragmented system where providers use multiple, disconnected tools for these five steps. The core idea is a single, continuous "ground-truth rail" that enforces data quality at the source and automates the handoffs between stages.
Research Purpose: To determine if any existing competitor offers a truly integrated, end-to-end workflow as envisioned by ABA Rail, or if they are primarily a collection of loosely integrated features. This will validate the core market opportunity.
Key Metrics:
	•	Workflow Gaps: Are there manual steps or data re-entry required between stages?
	•	First-Mile Data Integrity: How robust is the initial data capture at the point of care?
	•	Payer-Specific Automation: Does the system automate the creation of payer-specific documentation packets?

## Executive Summary

No competitor delivers a single, enforced “ground-truth rail” from RBT capture → BCBA clinical review → authorization governance → payer-ready packet → clearinghouse submission without exports or parallel tooling. The closest are CentralReach (tightest mobile capture + native claims gateways) and RethinkBH (solid review + utilization tracking + billing export/RCM option). TheraNest has strong approval/co-sign flows and built-in Apex clearinghouse. AccuPoint covers core ABA PM + auth tracking + e-billing, but workflows rely on conventional batching. Noteable advertises customizable approval workflows and RCM/billing features, but public docs don’t show automated pre-auth/claim “packet assembly” end-to-end. Net: the “payer-packet auto-assembly” and first-mile data integrity guarantees remain open space for ABA Rail to own.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼

## Detailed Flow Analysis (per competitor)

### CentralReach

Entry points
• CR Mobile appointment → RBT session datasheet → session note.  ￼
• Browser “Draft Timesheets” → approver submits → billing entry.  ￼
• Claims module → configured clearinghouse gateway (Waystar/Change Healthcare/Office Ally).  ￼

Step-by-step flow
	1.	Open CR Mobile, login/MFA → select today’s appointment. Time: ~10–20s [VERIFY].  ￼
	2.	Start Appointment → open Session → collect data live. Time: session length; capture is inline.  ￼
	3.	Graph All Targets → End Session → collect signatures (client/provider if required). Time: ~30–90s [VERIFY].  ￼
	4.	Complete Session Note → Save & Attach → confirm. Time: ~30–60s [VERIFY].  ￼
	5.	Timesheet confirmation → Draft Timesheets queue (browser) → Approve exceptions → Submit. Time: ~60–120s [VERIFY].  ￼
	6.	Billing creates entries → Claims module → send to configured clearinghouse (Waystar/CHC/Office Ally). Time: ~60–180s/batch [VERIFY].  ￼

Key metrics (est.)
• Total time (RBT + admin): ~3–6 min per session beyond service time [VERIFY].

## Pattern Recognition

### Universal patterns
	1.	Mobile or web session notes attached to appointments/timesheets to reduce re-entry and pull metadata automatically. Standard because it shortens note time and lowers error rate.  ￼ ￼
	2.	Supervisor approval/co-sign and/or pre-billing review before claims. Standard for compliance and auditability.  ￼ ￼ ￼
	3.	Clearinghouse-based claim submission (EDI/ERA) via direct gateway or export. Standard because payers mandate it.  ￼ ￼ ￼

### Unique approaches
• CentralReach: broad native gateways (Waystar/CHC/Office Ally) + mobile end-to-end RBT workflow. Effectiveness: High for reducing swivel chair during billing.  ￼
• TheraNest: first-class Apex integration + explicit approval queues. Effectiveness: High for operational clarity.  ￼ ￼
• RethinkBH: funder-aligned templates + dosage/medical necessity tools. Effectiveness: Med–High for prior-auth success.  ￼ ￼
• Noteable: custom supervision/approval workflows configurable by org. Effectiveness: Med; power depends on admin rigor.  ￼

### Nobody does this (opportunities)
	1.	Automatic, payer-specific packet assembly (re-auth & initial auth + claims attachments) from first-mile data with funder rulepacks, not just exports. Why it works: crushes manual “gather & format” time and cuts denials. [VERIFY]
	2.	Hard validations at capture (e.g., unit cap, location, rendering/supervising NPI, time overlap, EVV completeness) that block submission until compliant. Why: raise first-pass yield; fewer reworks. [VERIFY]
	3.	Cross-role “rail view” showing real-time progression of each session from capture → approval → auth burn → claim → ERA posted. Why: eliminates shadow trackers and status meetings. [VERIFY]

### Emerging trends
• Auth utilization governance + re-auth reminders seen in multiple tools, aimed at avoiding under/over-utilization. Motivation: revenue leakage prevention.  ￼ ￼
• RCM optionality (DIY export or turnkey services). Motivation: staffing flexibility.  ￼

## Ranked Implementation List (ABA Rail)

### Quick wins (ship first)
	1.	Capture Validators at Point-of-Care: enforce payer basics (units vs. time, POS, modifiers, supervising NPI present, EVV present if required) before note can be finalized.
– Effort: 20–40 hrs [VERIFY]. Impact: reduce claim edits/denials.
	2.	Single “Session Rail Card”: one card that shows status badges (Captured → Reviewed → Auth OK → Packet Built → Submitted → ERA).
– Effort: 24–32 hrs [VERIFY]. Impact: eliminate spreadsheet trackers.
	3.	One-click “Audit Bundle”: export timesheet + signed note + plan excerpt + auth letter for a date range.
– Effort: 16–24 hrs [VERIFY]. Impact: faster audits/appeals; customer wow.
	4.	Re-auth Watcher: burn-rate + ETA + templated BCBA prompts; nightly digest.
– Effort: 12–20 hrs [VERIFY]. Impact: avoid service gaps.
	5.	Template Handoff Map: map which data fields flow into claims (e.g., CPT, modifiers, diagnosis) to remove re-keying.
– Effort: 12–16 hrs [VERIFY]. Impact: fewer mapping defects.

### Medium-term (this quarter)
	1.	Payer Rulepacks v1: structured JSON for each payer’s note elements, signatures, time rounding, auth doc list, claim edit hints. Plug into validators and packet builder.
– Resources: 1 PM + 1 BA + 1 Eng + payer SME. Metrics: first-pass rate; time-to-packet.
	2.	Supervisor Workbench: queue with diff-view of changes, auto-checks (goals addressed vs. plan), batch approve with exceptions.
– Resources: 1 Eng + 1 UX. Metrics: review time per session; return-for-edit rate.

### Long-term innovations (6+ months)
	1.	Auto Payer-Packet Assembly: compile pre-auth/re-auth/claim attachments from source truth (plan, progress, signatures, EVV) into funder-specific PDFs/837p attachments.
– Advantage: category-defining. Investment: rules engine + doc composer + integrations. Moat: continuously updated rulepacks.

## Differentiation Strategy

Our position
• Strengths: first-mile data integrity mindset; cross-stage orchestration.
• Weaknesses: early ecosystem/integrations.
• Unique edge: payer-packet automation anchored to enforced capture.

Recommended positioning
• Don’t compete on generic PM features (everyone has calendars, notes, exports).
• Double down on rail integrity + payer automation (validators + packet builder + clearinghouse APIs).
• Innovate in explainable compliance (why a note fails; how to fix; one-click remediation).

Implementation roadmap
• Weeks 1–2: validators, rail card, audit bundle (Quick wins).
• Months 1–2: rulepacks v1 + supervisor workbench (Medium-term).
• Q2+: packet assembly + deeper clearinghouse integrations (Long-term).

Noteable	Yes; custom approval workflows  ￼	Yes (customizable)  ￼	Claimed (real-time auth/unit visibility) [3rd-party]  ￼	No [VERIFY]	RCM/billing messaging; claims automation claims (listings)  ￼ ￼	Docs are marketing-heavy


⸻

## Next Steps Checklist
	1.	Decide MVP validator set (units/time, POS, NPI, EVV).
	2.	Design “rail card” component for status across the five stages.
	3.	Spec packet builder v0 (audit bundle) and v1 (payer rulepacks).
	4.	Pick first clearinghouse API (e.g., Waystar or Change Healthcare) for direct submissions.
	5.	Interview 3 billing leads to confirm packet contents per top payers (Blue, UHC, Medicaid variant).
	6.	Shadow 2 providers on CR and TheraNest to time clicks; replace [VERIFY] with measured baselines.
	7.	Draft BCBA workbench requirements (diffs, batch approve, exception policy).

⸻

## Takeaways: No one delivers an enforced, automated, payer-specific rail today. The white space is automated packet assembly + capture-time compliance + real-time status. Build ABA Rail around first-mile integrity and last-mile submission to create a defensible wedge.

Immediate actions: implement capture validators, ship the rail card, and release an audit bundle; then layer payer rulepacks and a supervisor workbench; finally, deliver automated packet assembly with a clearinghouse API.
