### Your Input

**Product/Service:**
"ABA Rail" is a ground-to-payout operating rail for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) providers. It is a unified, stage-gated workflow platform that captures high-fidelity data at the point of care, routes it through required clinical reviews, packages the exact artifacts payers require, and automates the handoff to billing to close the revenue cycle loop.

**Target Geography:**
United States

**Customer Profile:**

*   **Type:** B2B
*   **Specific segment:** ABA provider clinics of all sizes, from small practices to large multi-state organizations.
*   **Pain point addressed:** The fragmentation of essential workflows across multiple disconnected systems, which leads to administrative overhead, slow approvals, high claim denial rates, and lost revenue.

**Pricing Model:**
(To be tested)
*   Per member per month (PMPM)
*   Per active staff seat (e.g., per RBT/BCBA)
*   Usage-based on packets/claims processed
*   Potential for a full-service RCM add-on charged as a percentage of collections.

**Competitive Context:**
This is a new category of "ground-truth rail." It is not just another EMR/practice management tool, but a workflow-first system designed to replace the patchwork of existing solutions. It competes with the status quo of using multiple disconnected tools and aims to become the core operating infrastructure for providers.

### Instructions

Calculate market opportunity using multiple approaches:

#### Step 1: Market Understanding

Confirm the business model and market dynamics (2-3 sentences).

#### Step 2: Calculate TAM (Total Addressable Market)

**Method 1: Top-Down Approach**

*   Start with: [Industry reports/statistics]
*   Total market size: $X
*   Relevant segment: Y%
*   Geographic filter: Z%
*   **TAM = $[Calculation]**
*   Sources: [List specific sources]

**Method 2: Bottom-Up Validation**

*   Total potential customers: [Number]
*   Average contract value: $[Amount]
*   Frequency: [Annual/monthly/etc.]
*   **TAM = [Calculation]**
*   Assumptions: [List key assumptions]

**Reconciliation:**

*   Top-down result: $X
*   Bottom-up result: $Y
*   Recommended TAM: $[Amount] (explain choice)

#### Step 3: Calculate SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)

Apply reality filters:

**Geographic Constraints**

*   Starting markets: [List]
*   Expansion timeline: [Years 1-3]
*   Regulatory limits: [Any restrictions]
*   SAM reduction: X%

**Product Fit Filters**

*   Feature limitations: [What you won't serve]
*   Customer size limits: [Too big/small]
*   Technical requirements: [Infrastructure needs]
*   SAM reduction: Y%

**Competitive Reality**

*   Incumbent lock-in: [Switching costs]
*   Market education needed: [New category?]
*   Channel constraints: [Distribution limits]
*   SAM reduction: Z%

**SAM Calculation:** TAM × Geographic% × ProductFit% × Competitive% = $[SAM]

#### Step 4: Calculate SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)

**Year 1 Achievable:**

*Based on Resources:*

*   Sales team capacity: [# of deals]
*   Marketing budget reach: [# of leads]
*   Product readiness: [Feature completion]
*   Maximum possible customers: [Number]

*Based on Comparables:*

*   Similar company A: [Year 1 revenue]
*   Similar company B: [Year 1 revenue]
*   Adjusted for market conditions: $[Amount]

*Conservative Estimate:*

*   Target market share: [0.X%]
*   Revenue per customer: $[Amount]
*   **Year 1 SOM: $[Amount]**

**Years 2-3 Projection:**

*   Growth rate assumption: X%
*   Market share progression: [Y1%, Y2%, Y3%]
*   Revenue targets: [$Y1, $Y2, $Y3]

#### Step 5: Scenario Planning

**Conservative Case (60% probability)**

*   TAM: $X, SAM: $Y, SOM: $Z
*   Key assumption: [What must be true]

**Base Case (30% probability)**

*   TAM: $X, SAM: $Y, SOM: $Z
*   Key assumption: [What must be true]

**Optimistic Case (10% probability)**

*   TAM: $X, SAM: $Y, SOM: $Z
*   Key assumption: [What must be true]
