# Executive Risk Strategy — ABA SaaS (Ideation Phase)

## 1. Executive Summary
You are in the **ideation phase** of building a HIPAA‑compliant, state‑aware SaaS platform for ABA providers. The goal at this stage is **big‑picture preparation** — understanding the regulatory landscape, anticipating where compliance investments will be critical, and positioning the business model to scale without major retrofits.

Key takeaways:
- **Core federal drivers**: HIPAA/HITECH, CMS interoperability & prior authorization rules, HIPAA Security Rule modernization (proposed), and HIPAA Privacy Rule reproductive health updates.
- **State-level multipliers**: Consumer health data laws that apply to *non-HIPPA* data (e.g., website telemetry), state-specific EVV mandates.
- **Strategic posture**: Design for compliance from day one, but avoid over‑engineering before product-market fit. Focus on **awareness**, **design choices that preserve options**, and **early relationship building** with legal/industry resources.

## 2. High‑Level Risk Categories (Strategic View)

### A. Federal Health Privacy & Security
- **HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach Notification Rules** — Baseline framework; design architecture to support PHI segmentation, audit logging, breach response.
- **Proposed HIPAA Security Rule Modernization** — MFA, encryption, asset inventories; likely to become best practice before formal deadlines.
- **Privacy Rule Reproductive Health Update** — Adjusts BA obligations, NPP updates due Feb 2026.

### B. State Data Privacy Laws (non-HIPAA data)
- Laws in WA, NV, and a 2025 wave of states regulate "consumer health data" and general personal data — can impact marketing sites, tracking, and consent UX.

### C. Medicaid EVV Mandates
- State-by-state rules for home‑based ABA services; EVV integration is required for Medicaid billing in many states.

### D. Payer Interoperability & Prior Authorization
- CMS rules will shape payer integrations by 2026–27; early awareness can prevent costly redesigns.

### E. Emerging/Conditional Risks
- FTC Health Breach Notification Rule — applies if any direct-to-consumer non-HIPAA health data features are added.
- 42 CFR Part 2 alignment with HIPAA — relevant if service scope expands into substance use disorder data.

## 3. Strategic Heat Map (Conceptual)

**By Region:**
- **High Attention:** West (WA, NV), South (TX, FL, TN), Northeast (NJ, DE)
- **Moderate Attention:** Midwest (NE, IA)

**By Category:**
- Data Privacy: High (state laws affecting even non-HIPAA data)
- Industry-Specific: High (HIPAA + EVV + payer requirements)
- Financial/Operational: Medium (claim denials from EVV noncompliance)

## 4. Roadmap — Ideation Stage Focus

**Phase 0–1 (Now through MVP design)**
- **Awareness Building:** Map federal & state obligations; identify key states/payers.
- **Architectural Guardrails:** PHI segregation, modular integrations, audit-ready logging.
- **Legal Relationships:** Engage HIPAA/privacy counsel for light advisory.
- **Industry Intel:** Join ABA industry groups, EVV vendor webinars.

**Phase 2 (Pre‑Market Fit)**
- **Select Target States/Payers:** Focus pilot on 2–3 states balancing market size and compliance complexity.
- **EVV Feasibility Scan:** Identify compatible EVV vendors.
- **Data Mapping Exercise:** Include both HIPAA and non-HIPAA data flows.

**Phase 3 (Market Entry)**
- Begin formal policy development, contracts (BAAs), and compliance documentation.
- Engage in EVV certification for pilot states.

## 5. Resource Forecast (Conceptual)
- **Legal Advisory:** Light-touch in ideation (10–15 hrs over 6 months), scale up later.
- **Compliance Officer Role:** Fractional or advisory until pre-launch.
- **Technology:** Early investment in architecture choices (e.g., database encryption, access controls).
- **Training:** Founders/staff HIPAA basics before handling PHI.

---

## 6. Monitoring Framework (Lightweight)
- **Official Sources:** HHS/OCR, CMS interoperability pages.
- **Industry Sources:** IAPP state privacy tracker, ABA provider associations.
- **Cadence:** Quarterly review in ideation; move to monthly in pre-launch.
- **Early Indicators:** New state law affecting target market; payer integration changes; EVV vendor spec updates.

---

## 7. Board/Partner Talking Points (Ideation)
- We have **mapped major regulatory forces** that will shape the product over the next 24 months.
- Our architecture will be **HIPAA-ready** from inception without over-investing pre‑market fit.
- We will **stage compliance spending** in sync with product maturity and market entry.
- Our monitoring plan ensures we can pivot quickly to address new state/federal requirements.
