# Notes

This folder serves as the central hub for all your personal and business notes, organized to support your knowledge management system.

## Purpose:
- **Centralized Note-Taking:** All new notes, whether from stream-of-consciousness or structured input, are processed and organized here.
- **Daily Notes:** Your daily logs, intentions, activities, and reflections are stored in daily-notes/.
- **Archival:** Older daily notes and processed content are moved to 4-Archive/old-notes/ for historical reference.
- **Project-Related Notes:** Notes directly associated with projects are found within the projects/ subfolder.

## How to Use This Folder:

### Creating New Notes:
To ensure consistency and proper tagging, always use the standardized note templates:
- **General Note Template:** For any new idea, thought, or piece of information.
- **Daily Note Template:** For your daily log, intentions, activities, and reflections.

You can find the detailed structure and usage instructions for both templates in the [[note-template-protocol]].

### Organizing Your Notes:
- **Daily Notes:** Store your daily notes in the daily-notes/ subfolder.
- **Archived Notes:** Daily logs and processed stream-of-consciousness notes are moved to the 4-Archive/old-notes/ subfolder for historical reference.
- **Projects:** All project-related notes and manifests are organized within the projects/ subfolder. Refer to the [[projects-README]] for details on project organization.

### Tagging and Connecting Notes:
All notes should be tagged according to the [[tagging-protocol|Tagging Protocol]] to enable powerful filtering and search.
- **Inter-Note Connections:** Use [[kebab-case-filename]] wikilinks (e.g., [[common-thread-website-outline]]) directly within your note content to create connections between related ideas and build your knowledge graph.
