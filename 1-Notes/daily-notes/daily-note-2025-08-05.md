### Meeting: Personal Board of Directors (2025-08-04)
*   **Summary/Key Takeaway:** The meeting focused on addressing a critical Supabase bug, which prompted a discussion about the user's overall technical strategy and the need for a repeatable tool stack. The board recommended a "diagnose and document" approach, time-boxing the bug diagnosis and simultaneously drafting a "v0.1" of the "80/20 Gap Protocol" as the problem is solved. The necessity of the blocking feature for the MVP should also be questioned.
*   **Detailed Synthesis:**
    *   **Problem:** A Supabase bug is blocking progress on the first app, highlighting a potential "80/20 gap" in the current technical approach.
    *   **Perspectives from Board Members:**
        *   **Anya (Pragmatic Engineer):** Emphasized diagnosing the root cause of the bug (tool vs. logic) before making a strategic pivot.
        *   **Marcus (Systems-Driven Founder):** Advocated for building a system (an "80/20 Gap Protocol") to handle future technical roadblocks, rather than focusing on one-off fixes.
        *   **Isabelle (No-Code Agency Builder):** Prioritized speed to market, suggesting de-scoping the blocking feature or pivoting to a simpler tool if it accelerates shipping the MVP.
    *   **Key Agreements:** The bug is a symptom of a larger strategic problem, and a formal process is needed for future situations. A major strategic decision (like pivoting the entire stack) should not be made without more data.
    *   **Debates:** Tension arose between understanding the current tool's limits (Anya) versus rapidly shipping on a mainstream platform (Isabelle), and between building a process (Marcus) versus shipping the product (Isabelle).
    *   **Resolution:** The board recommended a "diagnose and document" approach, time-boxing the bug diagnosis (4-6 hours) and simultaneously drafting a "v0.1" of the "80/20 Gap Protocol" as the problem is solved. The necessity of the blocking feature for the MVP should also be questioned.
    *   **Personal Decision Framework:** The user resonated most with Marcus's system-building mindset, planning to incorporate Anya's time-boxed diagnosis, Isabelle's pragmatism in de-scoping, and Marcus's protocol drafting.
