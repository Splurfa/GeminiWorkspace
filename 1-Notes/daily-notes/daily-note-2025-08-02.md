#### Business and AI Consulting Venture: From Idea to Action

This document outlines the foundational ideas, challenges, and strategic next steps for launching a solo or partnered AI consulting business, focusing on niche development and
operational execution.

##### 1. Venture Concept & Niche Identification

*   **Core Idea:** Establish a solo consulting business, potentially partnered with my friend Zach, under the agency name "The Common Thread."
*   **Niche Strategy:** Focus on AI consulting for non-technical individuals and businesses, leveraging Nate Jones' advice to specialize in application and strategy rather than technical
    coding. This addresses my non-coder background.
*   **Origin:** Inspired by successful AI application for Ashley Calzada (Stellar Steps), leading to the realization of broader business potential.

##### 2. Partnership Dynamics & Skill Synergy

*   **Zach's Role:** Zach brings valuable connections and "intangible skills" (soft skills, BCBA background) that complement the technical and operational aspects.
*   **Venn Diagram Analogy:**
    *   **Circle 1 (Zach):** Human-centric skills, strong connections, but lacks operational/technical understanding.
    *   **Circle 2 (Me):** Strategic, technical, and human synthesis; covers Zach's operational deficiencies.
    *   **Missing Circle 3:** A third element is needed to cover my technical deficiencies, allowing me to remain in the strategic middle.
*   **Collaboration Goal:** Ensure stability and proper deployment of ideas by having strong "bookends" for technical and human aspects.

##### 3. Strategic Approach & Pilot Projects

*   **Immediate Need:** Frame and package the consulting agency idea, including example projects as pilots or works in progress.
*   **Target Client:** Approach "Danny" (Zach's connection, number two at a company managing BCBAs) with the packaged proposal.
*   **Potential Partnership:** Danny expressed interest in seed money and collaboration after seeing an app example.
*   **Current Pilot Project:** Developing a behavior tracking application (Behavioral OS) for Zach's school, Hillel Hebrew Academy, as an alpha/beta pilot.
    *   **Timeline:** Needs to be finished within a week.

##### 4. Personal Development & Tooling Challenges

*   **Prompt Engineering:** Actively building prompt engineering knowledge and creating a prompt library, managed via Google Gemini CLI to populate a file system for prompts and stacks.
*   **Coding Landscape for Non-Coders:** Exploring Nate Jones' Substack articles for techniques to understand coding components and functions without direct coding. This is a high
    priority.
*   **Tool Stack Experimentation:**
    *   **Mem.ai:** Experimenting for central synthesis.
    *   **Gemini CLI:** Utilizing for file system population and structure from inputs.
    *   **Wispr Flow:** Used for voice dictation to improve pace and speed.
    *   **Lovable (Current Challenge):**
        *   **Issue:** Potentially prohibitively expensive and too complex ("too much going on under the hood").
        *   **Evaluation Need:** Requires help to determine if it's the right tool.
        *   **Past Experience:** Previous attempts to build projects in Lovable were inefficient (400 message credits for 80-90% completion), possibly due to improper engagement with its
            assistant.
        *   **Assistant Limitations:** The Lovable assistant, running an LLM instance, exhibited "context bleed, drift, mirroring, and glazing," leading to assumed fixes and potential
            hallucinations.

##### 5. Next Steps & Action Items

*   Develop a clear package/framing for the consulting agency.
*   Prepare example projects (e.g., the behavioral app) as pilots.
*   Approach Danny with the proposal.
*   Prioritize studying Nate Jones' Substack articles on coding for non-coders.
*   Evaluate the suitability of "Lovable" for ongoing development.
*   Refine the overall tool stack for efficiency and clarity.

### Insight 2: Personal Life Audit & Action Plan - 2025-08-02

**At a Glance Summary:**
*   **Immediate Challenges:** Urgent dental work (unfeasible on state disability), fixed income for 9 weeks, need for vehicle.
*   **Household:** Need to list/manage house/personal maintenance with Zach for Sophie, cat hair management (cleaning, brushing, air filters), household budgeting, essential items.
*   **Health:** Develop basic exercise routine (push-ups, hoops, dog walks), address physical condition, incorporate daily smoothies/meal planning, focus on long-term health.
*   **Financial Planning:** Address RV in repo status (payments, registration), track recurring financial obligations, plan for car registration, consider selling Zach's old car.
*   **Interdependencies:** All personal/household stability contingent on securing stable income (via consulting business). Relationships are important but deferred.

#### Personal Life Audit & Action Plan

This document outlines key personal challenges, immediate priorities, and long-term goals across health, home, and financial stability, emphasizing the need for structured planning
and consistent action.

##### 1. Immediate Financial & Health Challenges

*   **Dental Work:** Urgent need for extensive dental work, currently unfeasible due to state disability income.
*   **Fixed Income:** Operating on a fixed income for the next 9 weeks, requiring a strategy for sustainable growth.
*   **Vehicle Need:** Lacks a personal vehicle; obtaining one is contingent on securing income.

##### 2. Household & Shared Responsibilities

*   **House Maintenance:** Critical need to list and manage all categories of house and personal household maintenance for me and my best friend Zach, who are trying to raise his daughter
    Sophie in our house.
*   **Cat Hair Management:**
    *   Regular cleaning of curtains with a brush.
    *   Daily cat brushing.
    *   Acquisition of air filters (specific brand known, plan for filtration system in place, but requires budget).
*   **Household Budgeting:** Need to plan a budget to manage shared resources with Zach.
*   **Essential Items:** Identify immediate needs for the house that offer maximum impact for minimal input.

##### 3. Personal Health & Well-being

*   **Exercise Routine:** Develop a small, basic exercise routine focusing on no-excuse activities:
    *   Push-ups.
    *   Shooting hoops regularly.
    *   Daily dog walks around the block.
*   **Physical Condition:** Acknowledges being out of shape despite physical appearance, impacting self-perception.
*   **Nutrition:** Incorporate daily smoothies (Vitamix) and meal planning as part of a broader health and preventative measure, extending beyond dental health.
*   **Long-Term Health:** At 42, a focus on precautionary measures is essential.

##### 4. Asset Management & Financial Planning

*   **RV in Limbo:** An out-of-state RV is in repo status and requires immediate attention to untangle the situation.
    *   Ensure RV storage lot payments are current (Selma Storage, Oregon).
    *   Verify and update RV registration (under Zach's name).
*   **Milestone Dates:** Identify and track regularly recurring financial obligations (e.g., Sophie's insurance, tuition not covered by paycheck).
*   **Vehicle Strategy:** Plan for car registration costs and consider selling Zach's older car, which is nearing its last viable resale value.

##### 5. Interdependencies & Future Outlook

*   **Income Dependency:** All personal and household stability is contingent on securing a stable income, primarily through the consulting business.
*   **Relationships:** Acknowledges the importance of building and mending relationships, but prioritizes other immediate concerns for later.
