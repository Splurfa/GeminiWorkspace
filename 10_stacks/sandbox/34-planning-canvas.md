## **34\. Pre-Code Planning Canvas**

**Purpose:** Go from a vague app idea to a structured, actionable project plan before writing a single line of code.

**When to use:** At the very beginning of a new project to ensure clarity and alignment.

**Input needed:**

*   Your core app idea
*   Who it's for
*   The main problem it solves
*   Any initial feature ideas

---

### **Your Input**

**Core App Idea:** \[1-2 sentences describing your vision]

**Target Audience:** \[Who are the primary users?]

**Problem It Solves:** \[What critical pain point are you addressing?]

**Initial Feature Ideas:** \[List any features you're already thinking about]

**Monetization Strategy (if any):** \[How will this make money?]

**Key Competitors (if any):** \[Who else is in this space?]

---

### **Instructions**

Please transform my input into a comprehensive pre-code project plan using the following structure:

#### **Step 1: Core Concept Refinement**

*   **One-Liner:** A single, compelling sentence that captures the app's essence.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** Describe the ideal user's moment of discovery and delight.
*   **Core Value Proposition:** What is the single most important benefit you provide?

#### **Step 2: User-Centric Analysis**

*   **Primary User Persona:**
    *   Name: \[e.g., Marketing Mary]
    *   Role/Job:
    *   Primary Goal:
    *   Biggest Frustration:
*   **User Stories (5-7 critical ones):**
    *   "As a \[Persona], I want to \[action] so that I can \[benefit]."
    *   (Create 5-7 of these, covering the core functionality)

#### **Step 3: Feature & Operations Breakdown**

*   **Key Operations (The "Verbs"):** List the 5-7 most critical actions users can take (e.g., "Create Report," "Invite Team Member," "View Dashboard").
*   **Feature Prioritization (MoSCoW Method):**
    *   **Must-Have:** (Core features essential for launch)
    *   **Should-Have:** (Important, but not vital for initial launch)
    *   **Could-Have:** (Desirable but can be postponed)
    *   **Won't-Have (for now):** (Explicitly out of scope)

#### **Step 4: Technical & Design Guardrails**

*   **"Look & Feel" Adjectives:** List 5 adjectives to guide the visual design (e.g., "Clean," "Playful," "Trustworthy").
*   **Data to Protect:** What is the most sensitive user data we will handle?
*   **Success Metric #1:** What is the one number that will tell us if this app is successful?

### **Output Format**

Please generate the plan with clear, bolded headers for each section. Use bullet points for lists. The tone should be strategic, clear, and ready for a project kickoff meeting.
