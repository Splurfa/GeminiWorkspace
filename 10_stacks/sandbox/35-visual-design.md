### **Instructions**

Please generate a comprehensive visual design brief. The output should be a clear, actionable document that a UI/UX designer can use to start their work. Follow this structure:

#### **Step 1: Core Mood & Emotion**

*   **Primary Emotion:** What is the single most important feeling the user should have when they open the app?
*   **Visual Metaphor:** If this app's design were a physical object or place, what would it be? (e.g., "a well-lit architect's studio," "a cozy coffee shop," "a high-end sports car dashboard").

#### **Step 2: Color Palette**

*   **Primary Color:** (The main action color) Suggest a specific hex code and explain its psychological association.
*   **Secondary Color:** (For accents and secondary actions) Suggest a hex code and explain its role.
*   **Neutral Palette:** (For backgrounds and text) Suggest 2-3 shades of grey or off-white.
*   **Semantic Colors:** Suggest colors for Success, Warning, and Error states.

#### **Step 3: Typography**

*   **Heading Font:** Recommend a specific, web-safe font (e.g., from Google Fonts). Describe its personality (e.g., "modern and geometric," "classic and readable").
*   **Body Font:** Recommend a complementary, highly-readable font for paragraphs.
*   **Rationale:** Briefly explain why this font pairing works for the brand.

#### **Step 4: UI & Component Style**

*   **Corner Radius:** Sharp, slightly rounded, or fully rounded? Explain the feeling each conveys.
*   **Iconography Style:** Solid, line-art, or playful? Recommend a specific icon set (e.g., Feather Icons, Font Awesome).
*   **Button Style:** High-contrast with shadows, or flat and minimalist?
*   **Photography/Illustration:** Should the app use photos of people, abstract illustrations, or no imagery at all?

#### **Step 5: Overall Composition**

*   **White Space:** Abundant and open, or dense and information-rich?
*   **Layout Grid:** Structured and symmetrical, or creative and asymmetrical?
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** How do we make the most important elements stand out clearly?

### **Output Format**

Generate the brief with clear, bolded headers for each section. The tone should be inspiring and directive, providing a strong starting point for a designer while leaving room for their creative expertise.
