## 12\. Constrained Analysis Engine

**Purpose:** Create precise analyses within strict word limits and constraints.

**When to use:** Writing executive summaries, abstracts, or space-limited content.

**Input needed:**

* Topic to analyze  
* Exact constraints  
* Required perspective  
* Mandatory elements

---

### **Your Input**

**Topic:** \[What you need to analyze\]

**Exact Constraints:**

* Word limit: \[Exact number\]  
* Required sections: \[List any mandatory parts\]  
* Forbidden words/phrases: \[What you cannot use\]  
* Required frameworks: \[Must incorporate these\]  
* Sources required: \[Minimum number/type\]

---

### **Instructions**

Create precision analysis within constraints:

#### **Step 1: Constraint Acknowledgment**

Confirm all requirements and constraints (exactly 25 words).

#### **Step 2: Pre-Analysis Planning**

**Word Budget Allocation:**

* Total words available: \[Number\]  
* Introduction: \[X words \- Y%\]  
* Main analysis: \[X words \- Y%\]  
* Conclusion/recommendations: \[X words \- Y%\]  
* Buffer for editing: \[5-10 words\]

**Information Hierarchy:** Priority 1: \[Most critical point \- gets most words\] Priority 2: \[Second key point\] Priority 3: \[Third point\] Cut if needed: \[What's optional\]

**Compression Strategy:**

* Combine related ideas  
* Use precise verbs (eliminate adverbs)  
* Choose data over description  
* Remove redundancy  
* Implied connections

#### **Step 3: The Constrained Analysis**

\[Write the complete analysis following ALL constraints exactly. Hit the word count precisely, include all required elements, avoid forbidden terms, maintain perspective throughout.\]

#### **Step 4: Constraint Compliance Audit**

**Word Count Verification:**

* Target: \[X words\]  
* Actual: \[X words\]  
* Status: ✓ Exact match

**Required Elements Checklist:**

* \[ \] Element 1: \[Where included\]  
* \[ \] Element 2: \[Where included\]  
* \[ \] Element 3: \[Where included\]  
* \[ \] Framework applied: \[How\]  
* \[ \] Sources cited: \[Number\]

**Forbidden Terms Check:**

* Scanned for: \[List\]  
* Found: None ✓

**Perspective Consistency:**

* Maintained throughout: Yes ✓  
* Voice appropriate: Yes ✓

#### **Step 5: Compression Techniques Used**

**Word-Saving Swaps:**

* "utilize" → "use" (saved 4 characters)  
* "in order to" → "to" (saved 8 characters)  
* \[List 5-10 more examples\]

**Structure Efficiencies:**

* Combined \[X and Y\] into single sentence  
* Used semicolons to merge related ideas  
* Implied transitions vs. explicit  
* Chose active voice throughout

**Data Density Tactics:**

* Numbers replace descriptions  
* Percentages over explanations  
* Specific vs. general claims  
* Facts per sentence ratio: \[X\]

#### **Step 6: Alternative Versions**

**If You Had 25% More Words:** What would add first: \[Specific content\] Where it would go: \[Location\] Why it matters: \[Value added\]

**If You Needed 25% Fewer:** What would cut first: \[Specific content\] How to preserve meaning: \[Strategy\] Core message retained: \[Confirmation\]

**Different Perspective Version:** If written for \[different audience\]:

* Main change: \[What shifts\]  
* Different emphasis: \[What's highlighted\]  
* Altered conclusion: \[How it changes\]
