## 21. Day/Week Prioritizer

**Purpose:** Design energy-aligned schedules that match your biology to your priorities.

**Input needed:**

*   Date and fixed commitments
*   Energy patterns (when you're sharpest)
*   Everything on your mind
*   Key goals

---

### Your Input

**Planning Period:** [Specific date or week]

**Energy Pattern:** I'm sharpest in the [morning/afternoon/evening] and lowest energy at [time]

**Fixed Commitments:**

*   [Meeting/deadline with time]
*   [Meeting/deadline with time]

**Brain Dump:** [List everything on your mind - tasks, worries, projects, ideas]

**This Period's Priority:** [What must happen for this to be successful]

### Instructions

Create an optimized schedule through these steps:

#### Step 1: Commitment Audit

Review your fixed commitments and brain dump to identify:

*   True obligations vs. optional activities
*   Energy cost of each commitment
*   Hidden time requirements

#### Step 2: Define Three Wins That Matter

Based on your inputs, identify exactly 3 outcomes:

**Win #1: [Outcome, not task]**

*   **Why it matters:** [Impact if achieved]
*   **What "done" looks like:** [Specific, measurable]
*   **Time required:** [Realistic estimate]
*   **Energy needed:** High/Medium/Low

[Repeat for Wins #2 and #3]

#### Step 3: Create Energy-Aligned Schedule

**Peak Energy Blocks** (Your sharpest time)

*   Duration: [X hours]
*   Reserved for: [Most important cognitive work]
*   Environment: [What you need]
*   Preparation required: [Night before actions]

**Medium Energy Blocks**

*   Duration: [X hours]
*   Best for: [Type of work]
*   Specific tasks: [What fits here]

**Low Energy Blocks**

*   Duration: [X hours]
*   Suitable for: [Administrative/routine tasks]
*   Batch opportunities: [Similar tasks to group]

**Recovery & Transition Time**

*   Between meetings: [X minutes minimum]
*   After deep work: [Recovery activity]
*   End of day: [Shutdown ritual]

#### Step 4: Build Protection Strategies

**Say No To:**

1.  [Specific request type] - Script: "..."
2.  [Specific request type] - Script: "..."
3.  [Specific request type] - Script: "..."

**Communication Plan:**

*   Check messages at: [Specific times only]
*   Response expectations: [Set with others]
*   Focus mode hours: [When you're unreachable]

**Energy Preservation:**

*   Meeting prep strategy
*   Context switching minimization
*   Batch similar activities

#### Step 5: Reality Check

**Buffer Time Built In:**

*   Morning buffer: X minutes
*   Between commitments: X minutes
*   Emergency/overflow: X hours

**If Things Go Wrong:**

*   Priority order for dropping tasks
*   Minimum viable version of each Win
*   Communication plan for delays
