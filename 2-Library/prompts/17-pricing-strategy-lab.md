## 17. Pricing Strategy Lab

**Purpose:** Design safe pricing experiments to find optimal price points.

**When to use:** Considering price changes or launching new products.

**Input needed:**

*   Current pricing
*   Business priorities
*   Customer segments
*   Key metrics

---

### Your Input

**Current Pricing:**

*   Product/Service: [Name]
*   Price: $[Amount]
*   Model: [One-time/subscription/usage-based]

**Current Metrics:**

*   Conversion rate: [X%]
*   Churn/Refund rate: [X%]
*   Average revenue per user: $[Amount]
*   Customer acquisition cost: $[Amount]

**Business Priorities (ranked):**

1.  [Increase revenue/conversions/retention/margin]
2.  [Secondary goal]
3.  [Third priority]

**Customer Segments:**

*   Segment 1: [Description, % of base, price sensitivity]
*   Segment 2: [Description, % of base, price sensitivity]
*   Segment 3: [Description, % of base, price sensitivity]

---

### Instructions

Design pricing experiments scientifically:

#### Step 1: Current State Analysis

Summarize pricing position and opportunities (2-3 sentences).

#### Step 2: Design 3 Experiments

**Experiment 1: [Psychology-Based Test]**

*Hypothesis:* "If we [specific change], then [expected outcome] because [reasoning]"

*Test Design:*

*   Control: Current pricing ($X)
*   Variant A: [Price/structure change]
*   Variant B: [Alternative change]

*Target Segment:* [Which customers]

*Success Metrics:*

*   Primary: [Main KPI to track]
*   Secondary: [Supporting metric]
*   Guardrail: [What can't get worse]

*Sample Size Needed:*

*   Per variant: [Number of customers]
*   Duration: [Weeks needed]
*   Statistical confidence: 95%

*Risk Level:* Low/Medium/High

*   Why: [Risk assessment]
*   Mitigation: [How to protect revenue]

---

**Experiment 2: [Structure-Based Test]**

*Hypothesis:* "Changing from [current model] to [new model] will [impact]"

*Test Design:*

*   Control: Current structure
*   Variant: [New pricing model]
    *   Example: Good/Better/Best tiers
    *   Example: Usage-based pricing
    *   Example: Bundling approach

*Target Segment:* [Which customers]

*Success Metrics:*

*   Revenue per customer
*   Customer lifetime value
*   Segment migration patterns

*Sample Size & Duration:* [Details]

*Risk Level:* [Assessment]

---

**Experiment 3: [Positioning-Based Test]**

*Hypothesis:* "Reframing price as [new frame] will increase perceived value"

*Test Design:*

*   Control: Current presentation
*   Variant: New framing
    *   Example: Per-user vs. per-team
    *   Example: Monthly vs. annual emphasis
    *   Example: Cost vs. investment language

*Target Segment:* [Which customers]

*Success Metrics:*

*   Conversion rate
*   Price objection frequency
*   Average deal size

*Sample Size & Duration:* [Details]

*Risk Level:* [Assessment]

#### Step 3: Risk Mitigation Plan

**Gradual Rollout Strategy:**

*   Week 1: 5% of traffic/new customers only
*   Week 2: Expand to 20% if metrics hold
*   Week 3: 50% if positive or neutral
*   Week 4: Full rollout or rollback decision

**Stop-Loss Triggers:**

*   If conversion drops more than [X%] → pause test
*   If CAC increases more than [Y%] → pause test
*   If negative feedback exceeds [Z%] → investigate

**Customer Protection:**

*   Grandfather existing customers for [X months]
*   Clear communication about changes
*   Easy downgrade/cancellation path
*   Price-match guarantee period

#### Step 4: Test Sequencing Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundation Tests** (Months 1-2) Start with: [Lowest risk experiment]

*   Learn: Price sensitivity ranges
*   Risk: Minimal revenue impact
*   Data: Baseline elasticity

**Phase 2: Structure Tests** (Months 3-4) Move to: [Medium risk experiment]

*   Build on: Phase 1 learnings
*   Test: New models/bundles
*   Risk: Some complexity added

**Phase 3: Optimization** (Months 5-6) Finish with: [Refinement tests]

*   Optimize: Best performing structure
*   Test: Premium positioning
*   Lock in: Long-term pricing

**Dependencies:**

*   Test 2 requires Test 1 data because [reason]
*   Test 3 only if Test 2 shows [result]

#### Step 5: Measurement Framework

**Statistical Requirements:**

*   Minimum detectable effect: [X%]
*   Sample per variant: [calculated number]
*   Test duration: [days/weeks]
*   Confidence level: 95%
*   Power: 80%

**Tracking Setup:**

*   Analytics events: [What to track]
*   Attribution window: [How long to measure]
*   Cohort definitions: [How to segment]
*   Dashboard metrics: [Real-time KPIs]

**Analysis Plan:**

*   Daily: Monitor guardrail metrics
*   Weekly: Review conversion trends
*   End of test: Full statistical analysis
*   Post-test: 30-day impact assessment

#### Step 6: Communication Strategy

**Internal Alignment:**

*   Sales team: [What they need to know]
*   Support team: [FAQs and escalation]
*   Product team: [Implementation needs]
*   Finance team: [Revenue projections]

**Customer Communication:** *If price increases:*

*   Email timeline: 30 days notice
*   Value emphasis: [Key benefits to highlight]
*   Grandfather period: [How long]

*If structure changes:*

*   Migration path: [How customers move]
*   Benefits framing: [Why it's better]
*   Support resources: [Help documentation]
