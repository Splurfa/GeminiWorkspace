## 38. Incident Analysis System

**Purpose:** Conduct blame-free post-mortems to find root causes and prevent recurrence.

**When to use:** After any failure, incident, or unexpected outcome.

**Input needed:**

*   What happened with timeline
*   Impact and duration
*   Initial response actions
*   Current status

---

### Your Input

**Incident Description:** [What happened - factual summary]

**Timeline of Events:**

*   [Time]: [What occurred]
*   [Time]: [What occurred] [Continue chronologically]

**Severity Level:** [High/Medium/Low]

**Duration:**

*   Detection time: [When noticed]
*   Resolution time: [When fixed]
*   Total duration: [Hours/days]

**Impact:**

*   Who affected: [Users/systems/teams]
*   How affected: [Specific impacts]
*   Scope: [Number/percentage affected]

**Initial Response:** [What was done immediately]

**Current Status:** [Resolved/Monitoring/Ongoing]

---

### Instructions

Analyze systematically without blame:

#### Step 1: Incident Summary

Confirm the facts and timeline (2-3 sentences).

#### Step 2: Timeline Deep Dive

**Pre-Incident Phase**

*   Warning signs missed:
    1.  [Signal that something was wrong]
    2.  [Another ignored indicator]
*   Why missed: [Systems or human factors]
*   Could have noticed at: [When detection was possible]

**Detection Phase**

*   How discovered: [Automated/reported/stumbled upon]
*   Time to detection: [From start to awareness]
*   Detection effectiveness: [Good/poor - why]

**Response Phase**

*   First action: [What] - Time: [When] - Effect: [Result]
*   Second action: [What] - Time: [When] - Effect: [Result] [Continue for all major actions]
*   What worked well: [Effective responses]
*   What didn't help: [Ineffective attempts]

**Resolution Phase**

*   Ultimate fix: [What resolved it]
*   Why it worked: [Root cause addressed]
*   Time to implement: [How long]

#### Step 3: Five Whys Analysis

Start with surface problem and dig deeper:

**Problem Statement:** [What went wrong]

**Why 1:** Why did [problem] happen?

*   Answer: [Immediate cause]
*   Evidence: [How we know this]

**Why 2:** Why did [answer 1] occur?

*   Answer: [Deeper cause]
*   Evidence: [Supporting facts]

**Why 3:** Why did [answer 2] occur?

*   Answer: [Deeper still]
*   Evidence: [Data/observations]

**Why 4:** Why did [answer 3] occur?

*   Answer: [Systemic issue]
*   Evidence: [Patterns/history]

**Why 5:** Why did [answer 4] exist?

*   Answer: [Root cause - often organizational]
*   Evidence: [Cultural/systematic factors]

**True Root Cause:** [Summary statement]

#### Step 4: Contributing Factors Map

**Technical Factors:**

*   System design: [What made failure possible]
*   Monitoring gaps: [What we couldn't see]
*   Technical debt: [Shortcuts that hurt us]
*   Complexity: [What made it hard to diagnose]

**Process Factors:**

*   Documentation: [Missing/outdated/unclear]
*   Communication: [Breakdowns between teams]
*   Procedures: [Gaps in runbooks]
*   Training: [Knowledge gaps]

**Human Factors:** (No blame - system focus)

*   Cognitive load: [Too much to track]
*   Time pressure: [Rushing led to...]
*   Unclear ownership: [Who was responsible]
*   Competing priorities: [What distracted]

**Organizational Factors:**

*   Resource constraints: [Understaffing/budget]
*   Cultural issues: [Fear of speaking up?]
*   Incentive misalignment: [Rewards speed over safety?]
*   Leadership gaps: [Missing support/direction]

#### Step 5: Corrective Actions

**Immediate Fixes** (This week)

1.  **Action:** [Specific fix]

    *   Owner: [Name/role]
    *   Deadline: [Date]
    *   Success metric: [How we'll know it's done]
2.  **Action:** [Another fix] [Same format]

**Short-term Improvements** (Next month)

1.  **Action:** [Process improvement]

    *   Owner: [Name/role]
    *   Resources needed: [Time/money/people]
    *   Success metric: [Measurable outcome]

[List 3-5 improvements]

**Long-term Prevention** (Next quarter)

1.  **Action:** [Systematic change]

    *   Owner: [Senior sponsor needed]
    *   Investment required: [Realistic estimate]
    *   Expected outcome: [How this prevents recurrence]

[List 2-3 major changes]

#### Step 6: Success Metrics

**How we'll know we've improved:**

*Leading Indicators:*

*   Metric 1: [What to measure weekly]
*   Metric 2: [What shows early warning]
*   Target: [Specific improvement goal]

*Lagging Indicators:*

*   Incident frequency: [Current → Target]
*   Time to detection: [Current → Target]
*   Time to resolution: [Current → Target]

*Review Schedule:*

*   Weekly: [Quick metric check]
*   Monthly: [Deeper review]
*   Quarterly: [Full assessment]
