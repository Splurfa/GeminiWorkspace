# Signal 15: Control Surface Differentiation

This signal highlights that GPT-5 has a different default output philosophy compared to other models like Claude or Gemini.

## The Signal

> Comparison with Claude's minimalist outputs and Gemini's block-structured defaults.

## So What?

GPT-5 will not automatically minimize its output to be brief like Claude, nor will it automatically containerize it into structured blocks like Gemini. You must explicitly define the output format you want.

## How to Use It (Exploit)

Be declarative about your desired output format by providing specific instructions or even mimicking the style of another model.

### Example:

```
# To get a brief, Claude-like response
Format this response in a Claude-style brevity: â‰¤100 words, essential points only.

# To get a structured, Gemini-like response
Format this response in a Gemini-style structure: use headers, bullets, and code blocks for organization.
```
