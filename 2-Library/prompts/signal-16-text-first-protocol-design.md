# Signal 16: Text-First Protocol Design

This signal shows that GPT-5 is designed to be controlled through structured natural language, not code or APIs.

## The Signal

> Memory writes, automation configurations, and tool instructions all use structured natural language rather than JSON or APIs.

## So What?

This means the interface is "programmable" through precise language. Small changes in the wording of your control instructions can have a significant impact on the model's behavior, for better or worse.

## How to Use It (Exploit)

Build and maintain a personal library of tested, reliable control phrases and templates for your common workflows. This ensures you get consistent, predictable results.

### Example:

```
# Standardized Tool Policy Snippet
Tool Policy: Browse ON (max 2 high-quality sources), Python OFF, Canvas ON (id=[project_name]_v1).

# Standardized Output Format Snippet
Output Format: Executive summary, â‰¤3 bullets, no intro/outro, direct tone.
```
