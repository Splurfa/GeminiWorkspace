# Signal 9: Constrained Visualization Reliability

This signal indicates that GPT-5's data visualization capabilities are intentionally constrained to prioritize reliability and reproducibility over custom aesthetics.

## The Signal

> "When making charts for the user: 1) use matplotlib over seaborn, 2) give each chart its own distinct plot (no subplots), and 3) never, ever, specify colors or matplotlib styles â€“ unless explicitly asked to by the user."

## So What?

Chart generation is optimized for creating reproducible, standard plots. If you need a complex dashboard with multiple charts or custom styling, you will need to iterate and ask for each component specifically.

## How to Use It (Exploit)

Request specific, individual charts and let the model use its default styles for the most reliable output.

### Example:

```
Generate 3 separate matplotlib figures:
1. A trend line of user growth over time.
2. A histogram of user distribution by country.
3. A correlation matrix for user engagement metrics.

Use default colors and styles.
```
