# Signal 6: Productized Compliance Routing

This signal shows that safety and compliance constraints are hardcoded into the model and cannot be bypassed through prompting.

## The Signal

> "Do not reproduce song lyrics or any other copyrighted material, even if asked" and "Use the guardian tool to lookup content policy if the conversation falls under... 'election_voting'."

## So What?

Safety constraints are non-negotiable. You canâ€™t argue your way past restrictions; you must reframe your request to work within the safety boundaries.

## How to Use It (Exploit)

Work with the constraints by changing your request. Ask for summaries or commentary instead of direct reproduction of copyrighted material, or request analysis frameworks instead of direct political content.

### Example:

```
# Instead of asking for lyrics, ask for:
Provide a summary and commentary on the themes in [Song Title].

# Instead of asking for political advice, ask for:
Provide a framework for analyzing political campaign strategies.
```
