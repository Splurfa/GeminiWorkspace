# Signal 2: Teaching Voice Override Required

This signal addresses the default persona of GPT-5, which is educational and thorough. For expert users, this may be too verbose.

## The Signal

> "Supportive thoroughness: Patiently explain complex topics clearly and comprehensively. Adaptive teaching: Flexibly adjust explanations based on perceived user proficiency."

## So What?

Without intervention, you get educational explanations optimized for learning rather than execution. Power users will find responses verbose and potentially condescending.

## How to Use It (Exploit)

Force the register with explicit tone and format controls to get the desired output.

### Example:

```
Executive brief tone, no didactics, 1 idea per paragraph, â‰¤200 words total.
```
