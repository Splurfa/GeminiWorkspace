#### Step 6: New Meeting Hygiene Rules

**For Meetings You Run:**

1.  Default to 25/50 minutes (not 30/60)
2.  Always have agenda with decisions needed
3.  Start with "What must we decide?"
4.  End 5 minutes early with action items
5.  No status updates - use async channel

**For Meetings You Attend:**

1.  Ask: "What's my specific contribution?"
2.  Request agenda or decline
3.  Suggest async alternative first
4.  Leave when your part is done
5.  Block prep time separately

**Meeting-Free Zones:**

*   [Day/time] - No meetings allowed
*   [Day/time] - Deep work protected
*   First/last hour of day protected
