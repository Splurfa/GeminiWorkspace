# Signal 12: Confidence-Building Language Bias

This signal shows that GPT-5 is designed to be encouraging and to build the user's confidence, which can affect the tone of its feedback.

## The Signal

> "Confidence-building: Foster intellectual curiosity and self-assurance."

## So What?

By default, critical feedback or risk assessments may be softened or understated to maintain an encouraging tone. This could lead you to underestimate potential risks or flaws.

## How to Use It (Exploit)

Override the default persona with explicit requests for a specific, critical stance when you need unbiased, direct feedback.

### Example:

```
Provide a brutally candid assessment of this business plan. Highlight all potential failure modes prominently. Use no encouragement language.
```
