## 25. Personal Energy Mapper

**Purpose:** Discover your natural energy patterns and redesign your schedule to match.

**When to use:** Feeling constantly tired or wanting to optimize productivity.

**Input needed:**

*   Week's activity log with energy levels
*   Current role and responsibilities
*   Sleep schedule
*   Main energy complaints

---

### Your Input

**Weekly Activity Log:** [For 3-5 typical days, list:

*   Time: Activity (Energy level 1-5)
*   Example: 9am: Email (Energy: 3)
*   Example: 2pm: Important meeting (Energy: 2)]

**Current Role:** [Your job type and main responsibilities]

**Sleep Schedule:** [Typical bedtime and wake time, quality]

**Energy Complaints:**

*   When I crash: [Time of day]
*   What drains me most: [Activities/situations]
*   When I feel best: [Time/circumstances]

**Non-Negotiables:** [Fixed commitments you can't change]

---

### Instructions

Map your energy patterns and optimize:

#### Step 1: Data Acknowledgment

Summarize the energy patterns I see emerging (2-3 sentences).

#### Step 2: Create Energy Heat Map

**Morning Energy Profile** (Wake to noon)

*   Peak window: [Specific time range]
*   Energy level: [High/Medium/Low]
*   Best for: [Type of work]
*   Worst for: [What to avoid]
*   Pattern stability: [Consistent/Variable]

**Afternoon Energy Profile** (Noon to 5pm)

*   Peak window: [If any]
*   Trough window: [When you crash]
*   Recovery time: [When it improves]
*   Best for: [Type of work]
*   Worst for: [What to avoid]

**Evening Energy Profile** (5pm onward)

*   Second wind: [Yes/No - when]
*   Wind-down needs: [What helps]
*   Cognitive capacity: [What's still possible]
*   Best for: [Type of activity]

**Weekly Patterns:**

*   Monday energy: [Different from other days?]
*   Mid-week peak: [Wednesday phenomenon?]
*   Friday fade: [Energy changes?]
*   Weekend recovery: [How it affects Monday]

#### Step 3: Identify Energy Dynamics

**Energy Vampires** (Activities that drain more than they should):

1.  **[Activity]** - Why draining: [Root cause] - Solution: [Alternative approach]
2.  **[Activity]** - Why draining: [Root cause] - Solution: [Alternative approach]
3.  **[Activity]** - Why draining: [Root cause] - Solution: [Alternative approach]

**Energy Chargers** (Activities that restore):

1.  **[Activity]** - Why energizing: [What it provides]
2.  **[Activity]** - Why energizing: [What it provides]
3.  **[Activity]** - Why energizing: [What it provides]

**Transition Costs:**

*   Switching between [X and Y]: High energy cost
*   Batching opportunity: [Similar tasks to group]
*   Recovery needed after: [Draining activities]

#### Step 4: Optimized Schedule Template

Design your ideal day:

**Peak Performance Block** ([Your highest energy time])

*   Duration: [90-120 minutes]
*   Reserved for: [Most important cognitive work]
*   Environment: [What you need]
*   Preparation ritual: [5-minute routine]
*   Protection strategy: [How to guard this time]

**Secondary Focus Block** ([Next best time])

*   Duration: [60-90 minutes]
*   Best for: [Important but less demanding work]
*   Acceptable interruptions: [If any]

**Administrative Window** ([Lower energy time])

*   Duration: [45-60 minutes]
*   Tasks: [Email, routine work, meetings]
*   Batching strategy: [Group similar tasks]

**Recovery Periods**

*   Post-peak recovery: [15-minute activity]
*   Afternoon recharge: [20-minute routine]
*   Transition rituals: [Between work types]

**Meeting Strategy**

*   Best times: [When you can handle interaction]
*   Avoid times: [When you need focus]
*   Energy cost mitigation: [Prep/recovery needs]

#### Step 5: Three Energy Experiments

Test these for one week each:

**Experiment 1: Peak Protection**

*   Hypothesis: Protecting peak time increases output 50%
*   Method: Block calendar, no meetings, phone off
*   Measure: Quality of work produced
*   Adjustment if working: Make permanent

**Experiment 2: Afternoon Protocol**

*   Hypothesis: Strategic break prevents 3pm crash
*   Method: [Specific 20-minute routine at 2:30pm]
*   Measure: Energy level 3-5pm
*   Adjustment: Fine-tune timing/activity

**Experiment 3: Energy Matching**

*   Hypothesis: Matching tasks to energy improves satisfaction
*   Method: Follow optimized schedule strictly
*   Measure: End-of-day energy and accomplishment
*   Adjustment: Refine task categories

#### Step 6: Implementation Plan

**Week 1: Observation**

*   Track energy hourly
*   Note patterns
*   Don't change anything yet

**Week 2: Peak Protection**

*   Implement one protected block
*   Track impact
*   Adjust timing as needed

**Week 3: Full Template**

*   Follow optimized schedule
*   Note resistance points
*   Modify for reality

**Week 4: Refinement**

*   Keep what works
*   Adjust what doesn't
*   Create sustainable rhythm
