## 34. Pre-Code Planning Canvas

**Purpose:** Think through all the unknowns and risks before writing a single line of code.

**When to use:** Before starting any coding project to avoid costly pivots later.

**Input needed:**

*   Project concept (one sentence)
*   Why you're building it
*   Success metrics
*   Timeline constraints

---

### Your Input

**Project Name:** [Your project name]

**Core Concept:** [One-sentence description of what you're building]

**Problem It Solves:** [Why this needs to exist - 1 paragraph]

**Success Metrics:** [How you'll measure if it worked]

**Timeline:** [Available time/deadline]

---

### Instructions

Create a comprehensive pre-coding plan following these steps:

#### Step 1: Project Summary

Restate the project vision and constraints to ensure alignment (2-3 sentences).

#### Step 2: Map the Unknown Territory

Identify unknowns in three categories:

**Technical Unknowns**

*   List 3-5 specific technical questions
*   Rate each: Critical / Important / Nice-to-know
*   Cheapest way to test each

**User Assumptions**

*   List 3-5 assumptions about user behavior
*   Evidence you have (or don't have)
*   How to validate quickly

**Business Questions**

*   List 2-3 business/market uncertainties
*   Impact if wrong
*   Validation method

#### Step 3: Design Phased Approach

Break the project into 3-4 phases:

**Phase 1: [Name]** (Time estimate: X days/weeks)

*   **Goal:** What we're testing
*   **Deliverable:** Specific output
*   **Success criteria:** Measurable outcome
*   **Main risk:** Biggest threat to this phase
*   **Go/No-go decision:** Clear criteria to proceed

[Repeat for each phase]

#### Step 4: Create De-risking Strategy

**Riskiest Assumption:** [Identify the #1 risk]

**48-Hour Test Plan:**

1.  Specific experiment to run
2.  Resources needed
3.  Success/failure criteria
4.  Pivot options if it fails

#### Step 5: Decision Framework

**Kill Criteria:** List 3 conditions that would stop the project **Pivot Triggers:** List 3 signals that require direction change **Success Indicators:** List 3 early signs you're on track

### Output Format

Structure your response with:

*   Project Understanding
*   Unknown Territory Map
*   Phase 1: [Name]
*   Phase 2: [Name]
*   Phase 3: [Name]
*   [Phase 4 if needed]
*   De-risking Strategy
*   Decision Framework
*   Recommended First Actions (3 bullets)
