* Desired emotional outcome  
* Format (presentation/article/video)

---

**Current Approach:** \[How you typically present this information\]

---

### **Instructions**

Build a compelling story structure:

#### **Step 1: Message Confirmation**

Acknowledge the core message and desired impact (2-3 sentences).

#### **Step 2: Opening Hook Creation**

**Option 1: The Surprising Statistic** "\[Striking number or fact that challenges assumptions\]"

* Why it works: \[Creates cognitive dissonance\]  
* Transition to story: "But here's what that really means..."

**Option 2: The Relatable Moment** "\[Specific scenario everyone has experienced\]"

* Why it works: \[Immediate connection\]  
* Transition: "That moment reveals something important..."

**Option 3: The Provocative Question** "\[Question that makes them reconsider beliefs\]"

* Why it works: \[Engages curiosity\]  
* Transition: "The answer changed everything I thought I knew..."

**Recommended for your content:** \[Which option and why\]

#### **Step 3: Three-Act Structure**

**Act I: Setup (25% of time/space)**

*The World Before:*

* Status quo: \[What's normal/accepted\]  
* Character introduction: \[Protagonist \- could be customer/company/you\]  
* Stakes established: \[What matters and why\]  
* Inciting incident: \[What changes everything\]

*Key emotional beat:* Recognition \- "That's exactly my situation"

*Specific for your story:* \[Customized Act I outline with your content\]

**Act II: Journey (50% of time/space)**

*The Struggle:*

* First attempt: \[What they try that doesn't work\]  
* Obstacles emerge: \[Complications that arise\]  
* Dark moment: \[When all seems lost\]  
* Discovery: \[The insight that changes everything\]

*Key emotional beat:* Tension \- "How will this resolve?"

*Specific for your story:* \[Customized Act II with rising action\]

**Act III: Resolution (25% of time/space)**

*The Transformation:*

* New approach: \[How the discovery is applied\]  
* Results: \[What changes\]  
* New world: \[How life/business is different\]  
* Looking forward: \[What's possible now\]

*Key emotional beat:* Satisfaction \- "I see the path forward"

*Specific for your story:* \[Customized Act III with your resolution\]

#### **Step 4: Emotional Arc Mapping**

Chart the emotional journey:

**Opening:** \[Current emotion\] â†’ **Hook:** \[Shift to curiosity/concern\]

**Act I Progress:**

* Minute/Para 1-2: Recognition  
* Minute/Para 3-4: Investment  
* Minute/Para 5-6: Anticipation

**Act II Progress:**

* First third: Hope  
* Middle third: Doubt/frustration  
* Final third: Revelation

**Act III Progress:**

* Opening: Relief/excitement  
* Middle: Confidence building  
* Close: Inspiration/determination

**Peaks and Valleys:**

* Highest point: \[Where/when\]  
* Lowest point: \[Where/when\]  
* Final emotion: \[What they carry forward\]

#### **Step 5: Memorability Techniques**

**The Recurring Element:**

* Symbol/metaphor: \[Introduce early, return throughout\]  
* How it evolves: \[Changes meaning as story progresses\]

**The Unexpected Twist:**

* Setup assumption: \[What they expect\]  
* Subversion: \[What actually happens\]  
* Impact: \[Why it sticks\]

**The Concrete Visual:**

* Abstract concept: \[What's hard to grasp\]  
* Visual translation: \[Specific image/scene\]  
* Sensory details: \[Make it vivid\]

**The Rule of Three:**

* Three attempts/examples/lessons  
* Why three: \[Satisfying pattern\]  
* Your three: \[Specific to your content\]

#### **Step 6: Closing Call-to-Action**

**The Bridge:** Connect story resolution to audience reality: "You might not be \[protagonist\], but you face the same choice..."

**The Clear Ask:**

* Specific action: \[Exactly what to do\]  
* First step: \[Make it achievable\]  
* Timeline: \[When to act\]

**The Vision:** Paint picture of success: "Imagine \[specific scenario after taking action\]..."

**The Urgency:** Why now matters: "Every day you wait is \[specific cost/missed opportunity\]"
