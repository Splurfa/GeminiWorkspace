## 24. Automation Opportunity Scanner

**Purpose:** Identify tasks to automate with specific tools and ROI calculations.

**When to use:** Feeling bogged down by repetitive tasks or planning efficiency improvements.

**Input needed:**

*   Your workflow steps
*   Frequency of each task
*   Time spent
*   Current tools used

---

### Your Input

**Workflow to Analyze:** [Name the process/workflow]

**Current Steps:** [List each step in order with time required]

**Frequency:** [How often you do this - daily/weekly/monthly]

**Total Time per Cycle:** [Hours spent each time]

**Current Tools:** [Software/systems you're using now]

**Pain Points:** [What frustrates you most about this process]

---

### Instructions

Find automation opportunities systematically:

#### Step 1: Workflow Understanding

Summarize the process and time investment (2-3 sentences).

#### Step 2: Task Decomposition

Break down each step by automation potential:

**Step 1: [Current task name]**

*   Time taken: [X minutes]
*   Frequency: [Per week/month]
*   Type: [Manual data entry/Decision/Creative/Communication]
*   Automation potential: [High/Medium/Low/None]
*   Reason: [Why can/can't automate]

[Repeat for each step]

**Bottleneck Analysis:**

*   Biggest time sink: [Which step]
*   Most frustrating step: [Which one]
*   Most error-prone: [Which one]
*   Best ROI target: [Which to automate first]

#### Step 3: Top 5 Automation Candidates

Rank by ROI (time saved × frequency ÷ setup effort):

**1. [Task Name]** - ROI Score: [X]

*   **Current State:** [Manual process description]
*   **Time per Instance:** [X minutes]
*   **Frequency:** [X times per month]
*   **Monthly Time:** [Total hours]
*   **Suggested Tool:** [Specific recommendation]
    *   Cost: $[X/month] or free
    *   Setup time: [X hours]
    *   Learning curve: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
*   **How It Works:** [Brief explanation]
*   **Time Saved:** [X hours/month]
*   **Payback Period:** [X weeks]

[Repeat for top 5 opportunities]

#### Step 4: Implementation Roadmap

**Week 1: Quick Wins** *Goal: Save 2+ hours with minimal setup*

Tool 1: [Name]

*   Task automated: [What it replaces]
*   Setup steps:
    1.  [Specific action]
    2.  [Specific action]
    3.  [Specific action]
*   Time to implement: [X hours]
*   Weekly time saved: [X hours]

Tool 2: [Name] [Same format]

**Month 1: Core Automation** *Goal: Build foundation for major time savings*

*   Week 2: [Tool and what it automates]
*   Week 3: [Tool and what it automates]
*   Week 4: [Integration between tools]
*   Total monthly savings: [X hours]

**Quarter 1: Full Transformation** *Goal: Achieve 50%+ time reduction*

*   Month 2: [Advanced automations]
*   Month 3: [Optimization and refinement]
*   End state: [X hours/month saved]

#### Step 5: Tool Recommendations

**No-Code Options** (Start here):

1.  **[Tool name]** - Best for: [Use case]

    *   Price: $[X/month]
    *   Integration with: [Your tools]
    *   Template available: [Yes/No - link]
2.  **[Tool name]** - Best for: [Use case]

    *   Price: $[X/month]
    *   Pre-built automation: [What's ready to use]

**Low-Code Options** (Some technical skill):

1.  **[Tool name]** - For complex workflows
    *   When to use: [Scenarios]
    *   Investment required: [Time/money]

**Integration Platforms:**

*   [Zapier/Make/IFTTT] for connecting: [Which tools]
*   Recommended recipes: [Specific automations]

#### Step 6: ROI Calculation

**Investment:**

*   Tool costs: $[X/month] × 12 = $[Annual]
*   Setup time: [X hours] × $[Your hourly rate] = $[Cost]
*   Learning curve: [X hours] × $[Rate] = $[Cost]
*   **Total Year 1 Investment: $[Amount]**

**Returns:**

*   Time saved: [X hours/month] × 12 = [Annual hours]
*   Value of time: [Hours] × $[Rate] = $[Annual value]
*   Error reduction value: $[Estimate]
*   Stress reduction: [Qualitative but important]
*   **Total Year 1 Return: $[Amount]**

**Net ROI: $[Return - Investment]** **Payback Period: [X months]**
