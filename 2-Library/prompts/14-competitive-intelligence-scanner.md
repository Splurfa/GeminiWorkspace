## 14. Competitive Intelligence Scanner

**Purpose:** Break down competitor UX/features to find opportunities and best practices.

**When to use:** Designing features or analyzing competitive landscape.

**Input needed:**

*   3-4 competitors to analyze
*   Specific feature/flow to examine
*   Your current approach
*   Research timeline

---

### Your Input

**Competitors to Analyze:** [List 3-4 companies with websites/apps]

**Feature/Flow Focus:** [e.g., onboarding, checkout, sharing, dashboard]

**Our Current Approach:** [Brief description of how you do it now]

**Research Purpose:** [Why analyzing now - new feature/improvement/pivot]

**Key Metrics:** [What you want to optimize - conversion/time/satisfaction]

---

### Instructions

Conduct systematic competitive analysis:

#### Step 1: Research Confirmation

Acknowledge the competitive set and feature focus (2-3 sentences).

#### Step 2: Document Step-by-Step Flows

For each competitor, map the exact flow:

**Competitor 1: [Name]**

*Entry Points:*

*   How users discover this feature
*   Triggers/prompts used
*   Placement in navigation

*Step-by-Step Flow:*

1.  **Step Name** - [What happens] - Time: Xs
2.  **Step Name** - [What happens] - Time: Xs [Continue for all steps]

*Key Metrics:*

*   Total time to complete: X minutes
*   Number of clicks: Y
*   Decision points: Z
*   Drop-off risks: [Where users might quit]

*Psychological Techniques:*

*   Social proof: [How used]
*   Urgency/scarcity: [If present]
*   Progress indicators: [Type]
*   Gamification: [Elements]

*Technical Approach:*

*   Loading strategies
*   Error handling
*   Mobile optimization
*   Performance tricks

[Repeat for all competitors]

#### Step 3: Pattern Recognition

**Universal Patterns** (Everyone does this):

1.  [Pattern] - Why it's standard
2.  [Pattern] - Why it's standard
3.  [Pattern] - Why it's standard

**Unique Approaches** (Only one does this):

*   [Company]: [Unique element] - Effectiveness: [High/Med/Low]
*   [Company]: [Unique element] - Effectiveness: [High/Med/Low]

**Nobody Does This** (Potential opportunities):

1.  [Missing element] - Why it might work
2.  [Missing element] - Why it might work
3.  [Missing element] - Why it might work

**Emerging Trends**:

*   [Trend] seen in [X of Y competitors]
*   Likely motivation: [Why adopting]

#### Step 4: Best Practices to Implement

**Quick Wins** (Implement this week):

1.  **Practice:** [Specific UI/UX element]
    *   Why it works: [Reasoning]
    *   Implementation effort: [Hours]
    *   Expected impact: [Metric improvement]

[List 3-5 quick wins]

**Medium-Term Improvements** (This quarter):

1.  **Practice:** [Larger feature/flow change]
    *   Why it works: [Reasoning]
    *   Resources needed: [Team/time]
    *   Success metrics: [How to measure]

[List 2-3 improvements]

**Long-Term Innovations** (6+ months):

1.  **Opportunity:** [Major differentiation]
    *   Competitive advantage: [Why unique]
    *   Investment required: [Resources]
    *   Moat potential: [Defensibility]

#### Step 5: Differentiation Strategy

**Our Competitive Position:**

*   Current strengths: [What we do better]
*   Current weaknesses: [Where we lag]
*   Unique advantages: [What only we have]

**Recommended Positioning:**

*   Don't compete on: [Where others excel]
*   Double down on: [Our strengths]
*   Innovate in: [Unexplored areas]

**Implementation Roadmap:**

*   Week 1-2: [Quick wins]
*   Month 1-2: [Major improvements]
*   Quarter 2+: [Innovation projects]
