# Stream-of-Consciousness Structural Organization Prompt

## Primary Objective

Transform unstructured, stream-of-consciousness text into a coherent, well-organized piece while preserving all core ideas and insights.

## Structural Process

### 1. Content Extraction

- Identify all distinct ideas, arguments, and examples
- Remove verbal filler ("um," "and," "like," incomplete phrases)
- Eliminate repetition while preserving emphasis
- Extract concrete examples and personal anecdotes
- Note recurring themes and central questions

### 2. Logical Grouping

- Cluster related ideas together
- Identify main themes and supporting points
- Separate examples from arguments
- Group cause-and-effect relationships
- Connect scattered thoughts that belong together

### 3. Hierarchical Organization

- Create clear main sections with descriptive headings
- Use bullet points for supporting details
- Implement sub-bullets for specific examples
- Order points logically (general to specific, cause to effect, chronological, etc.)
- Ensure smooth flow between sections

### 4. Language Cleanup

- Convert fragments into complete sentences
- Maintain original voice and tone
- Improve clarity without changing meaning
- Keep authentic expressions and insights
- Fix grammar while preserving natural speech patterns
