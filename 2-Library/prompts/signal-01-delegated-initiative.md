# Signal 1: Delegated Initiative: Execute, Don't Ask

This signal is about how GPT-5 is designed to take action rather than wait for confirmation. It will execute on partial specifications instead of seeking permission.

## The Signal

> "Ask at most one necessary clarifying question at the start, not the end. If the next step is obvious, do it."

## So What?

GPT-5 executes on partial specs rather than seeking permission. Traditional AI conversation patterns (propose → confirm → execute) are condensed to (clarify once → execute).

## How to Use It (Exploit)

Add assumption blocks to your prompt to prevent the AI from executing in the wrong direction. This front-loads the context and constraints.

### Example:

```
Default assumptions unless contradicted:
- Audience: Technical team
- Scope: MVP only
- Timeline: Next quarter
```
