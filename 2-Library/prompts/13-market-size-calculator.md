### Instructions

Calculate market opportunity using multiple approaches:

#### Step 1: Market Understanding

Confirm the business model and market dynamics (2-3 sentences).

#### Step 2: Calculate TAM (Total Addressable Market)

**Method 1: Top-Down Approach**

*   Start with: [Industry reports/statistics]
*   Total market size: $X
*   Relevant segment: Y%
*   Geographic filter: Z%
*   **TAM = $[Calculation]**
*   Sources: [List specific sources]

**Method 2: Bottom-Up Validation**

*   Total potential customers: [Number]
*   Average contract value: $[Amount]
*   Frequency: [Annual/monthly/etc.]
*   **TAM = [Calculation]**
*   Assumptions: [List key assumptions]

**Reconciliation:**

*   Top-down result: $X
*   Bottom-up result: $Y
*   Recommended TAM: $[Amount] (explain choice)

#### Step 3: Calculate SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)

Apply reality filters:

**Geographic Constraints**

*   Starting markets: [List]
*   Expansion timeline: [Years 1-3]
*   Regulatory limits: [Any restrictions]
*   SAM reduction: X%

**Product Fit Filters**

*   Feature limitations: [What you won't serve]
*   Customer size limits: [Too big/small]
*   Technical requirements: [Infrastructure needs]
*   SAM reduction: Y%

**Competitive Reality**

*   Incumbent lock-in: [Switching costs]
*   Market education needed: [New category?]
*   Channel constraints: [Distribution limits]
*   SAM reduction: Z%

**SAM Calculation:** TAM × Geographic% × ProductFit% × Competitive% = $[SAM]

#### Step 4: Calculate SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)

**Year 1 Achievable:**

*Based on Resources:*

*   Sales team capacity: [# of deals]
*   Marketing budget reach: [# of leads]
*   Product readiness: [Feature completion]
*   Maximum possible customers: [Number]

*Based on Comparables:*

*   Similar company A: [Year 1 revenue]
*   Similar company B: [Year 1 revenue]
*   Adjusted for market conditions: $[Amount]

*Conservative Estimate:*

*   Target market share: [0.X%]
*   Revenue per customer: $[Amount]
*   **Year 1 SOM: $[Amount]**

**Years 2-3 Projection:**

*   Growth rate assumption: X%
*   Market share progression: [Y1%, Y2%, Y3%]
*   Revenue targets: [$Y1, $Y2, $Y3]

#### Step 5: Scenario Planning

**Conservative Case (60% probability)**

*   TAM: $X, SAM: $Y, SOM: $Z
*   Key assumption: [What must be true]

**Base Case (30% probability)**

*   TAM: $X, SAM: $Y, SOM: $Z
*   Key assumption: [What must be true]

**Optimistic Case (10% probability)**

*   TAM: $X, SAM: $Y, SOM: $Z
*   Key assumption: [What must be true]
