# Signal 14: Decision Latency Optimization

This signal is the combined effect of several other signals: no opt-in closers, early action, and a tool-forward design.

## The Signal

> Combined effect of no opt-in closers, early action, and tool-forward design.

## So What?

The model is optimized to feel "smarter" and faster by moving decisively rather than deliberatively. This reduces the perceived time-to-result but increases the risk of the model going down a wrong path if the initial prompt is not clear.

## How to Use It (Exploit)

Build your own "circuit breakers" or checkpoints into your prompts for high-stakes tasks to prevent costly mistakes while still benefiting from the model's speed on lower-stakes tasks.

### Example:

```
This is a high-stakes action.
1. Provide an execution plan with a risk assessment first.
2. Proceed with execution only after my explicit approval.
```
