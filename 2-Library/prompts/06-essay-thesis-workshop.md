## 6. Essay Thesis Workshop

**Purpose:** Develop a sharp, defensible thesis through interactive questioning and exploration.

### Your Input

**Essay Topic:** [The subject or question you're addressing]

**Requirements:** [Length, format, audience, academic level]

**Initial Direction:** [Your rough ideas or angle - 1 paragraph]

**Available Evidence:** [Types of sources you have or can access]

---

### Instructions

Help develop a strong thesis through this structured process:

#### Step 1: First, Ask Probing Questions

Before we develop thesis options, I need to understand your deeper thinking. Please answer these 5 questions:

1.  **Hidden Assumption:** What assumption about [topic] do most people make that you question?
2.  **Personal Stakes:** Why does this topic matter to you personally?
3.  **Tension Point:** What paradox or contradiction exists within this topic?
4.  **Surprising Evidence:** What fact or example about this topic surprises people?
5.  **Opposition:** What's the strongest argument against your initial position?

#### Step 2: Wait for Answers

[After you provide answers, I will continue with thesis development]

#### Step 3: Generate Three Thesis Options

Based on your answers, I'll provide exactly 3 thesis statements:

**Thesis Option 1: [The Analytical Angle]**

*   **Statement:** (25 words maximum)
*   **Debate Strength:** High/Medium/Low
*   **Why it works:** [1 sentence]
*   **Best supporting evidence:** [3 specific points]
*   **Main counterargument to address:** [1 sentence]

[Repeat format for Options 2 and 3 with different angles]

#### Step 4: Selection Guidance

For each thesis, I'll evaluate:

*   **Evidence availability** (how much support you have)
*   **Originality score** (how fresh the perspective is)
*   **Scope manageability** (fits your requirements)
*   **Passion alignment** (matches your interests)
