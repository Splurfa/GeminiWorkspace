*   **Evidence from Notes:** [Specific examples]
*   **Impact on Team:** [How team responds]
*   **Effectiveness Rating:** [High/Medium/Low]

#### Step 3: Pattern Recognition

**Your Default Style:** [Primary style you use most]

*   Why you default here: [Comfort/success/habit]

**Your Biggest Blind Spot:** [The style you most need to develop]

Why this is a blind spot:

*   What you miss: [Impact/opportunities]
*   Team's unmet needs: [What they need more of]
*   Business impact: [How it affects results]

First steps to address:

1.  [Specific practice this week]
2.  [Feedback to seek]
3.  [Success metric]

#### Step 5: 30-Day Development Plan

**Week 1: Awareness Building**

*   Daily practice: [5-minute reflection on style used]
*   Key question: "What style did I just use?"
*   Evening note: Record one style shift attempt

**Week 2: Opposite Style Practice**

*   Target style: [Your weakest/least comfortable]
*   Daily challenge: Use it once intentionally
*   Practice scenario: [Specific meeting/interaction]
*   Success metric: [What indicates progress]

**Week 3: Stress Response Training**

*   Trigger awareness: Note when shifting to stress style
*   Pause practice: 30-second break before responding

*   Support needed: [Accountability partner/reminder]

**Week 4: Integration & Feedback**

*   Team check-in: "What leadership style do you need more of?"
*   Style flexibility: Match style to situation consciously
*   Reflection: What's easier/harder than expected
*   Next 30-day focus: [Based on learnings]

#### Step 6: Situational Application Guide

**When to use each style:**

*   **Crisis requiring immediate action:** Start with Coercive, shift to Authoritative
*   **Team morale is low:** Lead with Affiliative, add Democratic
*   **Developing high performers:** Coaching primary, Pacesetting sparingly
*   **Major change initiative:** Authoritative to set vision, Democratic for buy-in
*   **Building consensus:** Democratic primary, Affiliative to maintain relationships
*   **Fixing performance issues:** Coaching first, Coercive only if necessary
