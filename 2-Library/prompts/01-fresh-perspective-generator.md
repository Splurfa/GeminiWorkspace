## 1. Fresh Perspective Generator

**Purpose:** Break out of conventional thinking by generating radically different viewpoints on any challenge.

**When to use:** When you're stuck in a mental rut or need innovative approaches to problems.

**Input needed:**

*   Your challenge or problem
*   How you're currently thinking about it
*   Any constraints to consider

---

### Your Input

**Challenge:** [Describe your specific problem or goal in 1-2 sentences]

**Current Approach:** [How you're thinking about it now - 1 paragraph max]

**Constraints:** [List any limitations: budget, time, resources, etc.]

---

### Instructions

Please analyze my challenge using the following step-by-step process:

#### Step 1: Acknowledge the Challenge

First, briefly summarize my challenge in your own words to ensure understanding (2-3 sentences).

#### Step 2: Generate Three Perspectives

Create exactly 3 unconventional perspectives, ordered from most practical to most radical.

For each perspective, provide:

1.  **Reframe Title** (5-10 words)
2.  **Core Insight** (1 sentence explaining the shift in thinking)
3.  **Vivid Story** (100-150 words) - A thought experiment or scenario illustrating this perspective
4.  **Memorable Metaphor** (1 sentence comparing the challenge to something unexpected)
5.  **Action Tagline** (Under 12 words - what to do differently)

#### Step 3: Implementation Bridge

For the most practical perspective only, add:

*   First concrete step I could take tomorrow
*   Key metric to track progress
*   Potential obstacle and how to overcome it

---

### Output Format

Structure your response with clear headers:

*   Summary of Understanding
*   Perspective 1: [Most Practical]
*   Perspective 2: [Moderately Radical]
*   Perspective 3: [Most Radical]
*   Implementation Bridge

Keep the tone conversational but insightful. Make me think "I never saw it that way!"
