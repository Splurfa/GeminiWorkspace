### Instructions

Maximize conference value strategically:

#### Step 1: Goal Alignment

Confirm understanding of your objectives and investment (2-3 sentences).

#### Step 2: Pre-Conference Preparation

**4 Weeks Before:**

*   [ ] Book travel (optimal arrival: day before at 2pm)
*   [ ] Research speaker list for target connections
*   [ ] Update LinkedIn with "Attending [Conference]"
*   [ ] Order fresh business cards

**2 Weeks Before:**

*   [ ] Email top 5 targets: "I'll be at [Conference]. Coffee?"
*   [ ] Schedule 3-5 meetings outside main sessions
*   [ ] Join conference app/Slack/Discord
*   [ ] Plan your session attendance strategy

**1 Week Before:**

*   [ ] Prepare elevator pitch (3 versions: 10/30/60 seconds)
*   [ ] Set out-of-office message
*   [ ] Download offline maps
*   [ ] Prep follow-up templates

**Day Before:**

*   [ ] Review final schedule
*   [ ] Confirm meetings
*   [ ] Charge all devices
*   [ ] Set intentions

#### Step 3: Session Strategy

**Must-Attend Sessions:** Based on your goals:

1.  [Session name] - Why: [Direct goal alignment]
2.  [Session name] - Why: [Speaker you must meet]
3.  [Session name] - Why: [Critical topic]

**Strategic Skips:** Sessions to intentionally miss for networking:

1.  [Popular session] - Instead: [Coffee with key person]
2.  [Panel you can watch later] - Instead: [Vendor happy hour]

**Energy Management:**

*   Morning: High-value sessions
*   Post-lunch: Networking (everyone's tired)
*   Late afternoon: Vendor floor when empty
*   Evening: Curated social events only

#### Step 4: Connection Plan

**Top 5 People to Meet:**

**Person 1: [Name - Title - Company]**

*   Why them: [Specific value/connection]
*   Where to find: [Sessions they're speaking at]
*   Opening line: "[Specific conversation starter]"
*   Ask: [One specific question]
*   Give: [Value you can offer]
*   Follow-up commitment: [Specific action]

[Repeat for all 5 targets]

**Serendipity Optimization:**

*   Sit in aisle seats (easy conversation)
*   Arrive early to sessions (pre-talk chat)
*   Use breaks strategically (don't check email)
*   One meal alone per day (join strangers)

#### Step 5: Daily Execution Plan

**Each Conference Day:**

**Morning Routine** (30 minutes)

*   Review day's targets
*   Set 3 connection goals
*   Prep conversation topics
*   Full phone charge

**During the Day:**

*   Take notes on phone (easier than notebook)
*   Photo of every business card immediately
*   Voice memo after great conversations
*   Tweet/post one insight (tag speakers)

**Evening Protocol** (45 minutes)

*   Send same-day follow-ups to A-list contacts
*   Log all connections in CRM/spreadsheet
*   Plan tomorrow's targets
*   One recovery activity (walk/gym/sleep)

#### Step 6: ROI Multiplication

**During Conference:**

*   Share key insights on LinkedIn (tag conference)
*   Introduce two people who should meet
*   Host informal breakfast/coffee gathering
*   Take photos with speakers (social proof)

**Follow-Up Schedule:**

*   Within 24 hours: A-list contacts
*   Within 3 days: B-list contacts
*   Within 1 week: General connections
*   Within 2 weeks: Thank speakers

**Follow-Up Templates:**

*A-List (met your main target):* "Hi [Name], Our conversation about [specific topic] really resonated. As promised, here's [resource mentioned]. I'd love to continue discussing [specific opportunity]. Are you free for a call [suggest 2 times]?"

*B-List (valuable but not critical):* "Great meeting you at [Conference]. Your point about [specific thing] got me thinking. I'd love to stay connected - what's the best way to follow your work?"

*Speaker appreciation:* "Your session on [topic] was the highlight of [Conference] for me. The point about [specific] will change how I [application]. Thank you for sharing your expertise."

#### Step 7: Success Metrics

**Quantitative ROI:**

*   Direct business opportunities: $[target]
*   Valuable connections made: [number]
*   Cost per quality connection: $[total cost/connections]
*   Knowledge applied to generate: $[value]

**Qualitative ROI:**

*   New perspectives gained: [list]
*   Energy/motivation boost: [rating]
*   Industry positioning: [improvement]
*   Future opportunities created: [what's possible now]

**6-Month Check-In:**

*   Opportunities materialized: [Results]

*   Decision: Worth attending again? [Y/N because...]
