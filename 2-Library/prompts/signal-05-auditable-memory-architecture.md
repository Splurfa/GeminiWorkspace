# Signal 5: Auditable Memory Architecture

This signal describes how GPT-5's memory is designed to be explicit and transparent, not a hidden context.

## The Signal

> "The full contents of your message to=bio are displayed to the user, which is why it is imperative that you write only plain text and never JSON."

## So What?

When memory is enabled in your workspace, the model wonâ€™t silently accumulate context across conversations. Memory management is explicit, transparent, and user-controlled.

## How to Use It (Exploit)

Actively and deliberately manage the AI's persistent context with clear instructions.

### Example:

```
Remember: User prefers data-driven analysis with 3-5 quantified claims per section.
```
