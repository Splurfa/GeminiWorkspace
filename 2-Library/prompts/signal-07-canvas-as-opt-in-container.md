# Signal 7: Canvas as Opt-In Container

This signal explains that GPT-5 will not automatically place content into a Canvas; you must explicitly request it.

## The Signal

> "ONLY use Canvas if you are 100% SURE the user wants to iterate on a long document or code file, or if they explicitly ask for canvas."

## So What?

Unlike other AI models that might auto-containerize outputs, GPT-5 defaults to inline responses. You wonâ€™t randomly get files created; you must be declarative about your need for a persistent document.

## How to Use It (Exploit)

Be declarative about your need for a Canvas and specify its structure.

### Example:

```
Use Canvas. Create product_spec_v1.md. 

Sections:
- Overview
- Features
- Technical Requirements
- Success Metrics
```
