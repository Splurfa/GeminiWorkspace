## 30. Energy Audit Protocol

**Purpose:** Identify exactly what drains and energizes you for life design.

**When to use:** Feeling burned out or planning major life changes.

**Input needed:**

*   Recent typical week
*   Energy highs and lows
*   Current commitments
*   Life priorities

---

### Your Input

**Recent Typical Week:** [For each day, note key activities and energy levels 1-10]

*   Monday: [Activities with energy ratings]
*   Tuesday: [Activities with energy ratings]
*   Wednesday: [Activities with energy ratings]
*   Thursday: [Activities with energy ratings]
*   Friday: [Activities with energy ratings]
*   Weekend: [Key activities and energy]

**Peak Energy Moments:** [When you felt most alive/engaged/flowing]

**Energy Crashes:** [When you felt most drained/depleted/resistant]

**Current Major Commitments:**

1.  [Time commitment - hours/week - energy cost]
2.  [Time commitment - hours/week - energy cost]
3.  [Time commitment - hours/week - energy cost]

**Life Priorities:** [What matters most - ranked]

---

### Instructions

Audit your life energy comprehensively:

#### Step 1: Pattern Recognition

Identify the energy patterns emerging from your week (2-3 sentences).

#### Step 2: Energy Balance Sheet

**Energy Deposits** (What fills you up):

*Category: Purpose/Meaning*

*   Activity: [What you did] → Energy gain: +[1-10]
*   Activity: [What you did] → Energy gain: +[1-10]
*   Pattern: [When meaning creates energy]

*Category: Connection/Relationships*

*   Activity: [Interaction type] → Energy gain: +[1-10]
*   Activity: [Interaction type] → Energy gain: +[1-10]
*   Pattern: [Which connections energize]

*Category: Achievement/Progress*

*   Activity: [What accomplished] → Energy gain: +[1-10]
*   Activity: [What accomplished] → Energy gain: +[1-10]
*   Pattern: [What progress energizes]

*Category: Joy/Play/Flow*

*   Activity: [What brought joy] → Energy gain: +[1-10]
*   Activity: [What brought joy] → Energy gain: +[1-10]
*   Pattern: [When you enter flow]

**Energy Withdrawals** (What drains you):

*Category: Obligations/Shoulds*

*   Activity: [What you "had to"] → Energy cost: -[1-10]
*   Activity: [What you "had to"] → Energy cost: -[1-10]
*   Pattern: [Which obligations drain most]

*Category: Misalignment*

*   Activity: [Against values/strengths] → Energy cost: -[1-10]
*   Activity: [Against values/strengths] → Energy cost: -[1-10]
*   Pattern: [Where you're out of alignment]

*Category: Friction/Conflict*

*   Activity: [Difficult interaction] → Energy cost: -[1-10]
*   Activity: [Difficult interaction] → Energy cost: -[1-10]
*   Pattern: [What creates friction]

*Category: Overwhelm/Chaos*

*   Activity: [What overwhelms] → Energy cost: -[1-10]
*   Activity: [What overwhelms] → Energy cost: -[1-10]
*   Pattern: [When chaos drains]

**Net Energy Balance:** [Overall positive/negative/neutral]

#### Step 3: Hidden Energy Drains

**Subtle Tolerations:**

1.  [Small annoyance you've normalized] - Daily cost: -[X]
2.  [Environment issue ignored] - Daily cost: -[X]
3.  [Relationship dynamic accepted] - Weekly cost: -[X]

**Cumulative Impact:** [Total hidden drain]

**Misaligned Activities:**

*   Doing: [Activity]
*   Because: [Why you do it]
*   Energy cost: [How much it takes]
*   Alternative: [What could replace it]

**Energy Vampires:** (People/situations that consistently drain)

1.  [Who/what] - Why draining: [Pattern]
2.  [Who/what] - Why draining: [Pattern]

**Recovery Gaps:**

*   After [draining activity], need [X hours] to recover
*   Currently getting: [Less than needed]
*   Deficit impact: [How it compounds]

#### Step 4: Energy Optimization Strategy

**Quick Wins** (This week):

1.  **Eliminate:** [Lowest-value drain]

    *   How: [Specific action]
    *   Time freed: [Hours]
    *   Energy recovered: +[Amount]
2.  **Delegate:** [What others could do]

    *   To whom: [Person/service]
    *   Investment: [Time/money]
    *   Energy recovered: +[Amount]
3.  **Batch:** [Similar draining tasks]

    *   New schedule: [When grouped]
    *   Efficiency gain: [Time saved]
    *   Energy preserved: +[Amount]

**Medium Changes** (This month):

1.  **Renegotiate:** [Commitment to adjust]

    *   Current terms: [What now]
    *   Proposed terms: [What instead]
    *   Conversation approach: [How to ask]
2.  **Redesign:** [Activity to transform]

    *   Current approach: [How done now]
    *   Energizing version: [New method]
    *   Implementation: [Steps to change]

**Life Redesign** (This year):

1.  **Major shift:** [Big change needed]
    *   From: [Current state]
    *   To: [Desired state]
    *   First step: [Where to begin]
    *   Timeline: [Realistic phases]

#### Step 5: Energy Investment Portfolio

**Reallocation Plan:**

*Divest From (Reduce by 50%+):*

*   [Energy drain category]: From [X] to [Y] hours
*   [Energy drain category]: From [X] to [Y] hours
*   Method: [How to reduce]

*Maintain (Keep stable):*

*   [Neutral activity]: [X] hours - Why needed
*   [Neutral activity]: [X] hours - Why needed

*Invest More (Increase by 50%+):*

*   [Energy source]: From [X] to [Y] hours
*   [Energy source]: From [X] to [Y] hours
*   Method: [How to increase]

*New Experiments:*

1.  [Potential energy source to try]
    *   Hypothesis: [Why it might energize]
    *   Test: [One-week trial]
    *   Success metric: [Energy level target]

#### Step 6: Sustainable Implementation

**Week 1-2: Foundation**

*   Track energy daily (1-10 scale)
*   Implement quick wins
*   Notice resistance patterns

**Week 3-4: Momentum**

*   Make medium changes
*   Measure energy shifts
*   Adjust based on data

**Month 2-3: Transformation**

*   Begin life redesign elements
*   Build new routines
*   Celebrate energy gains

**Ongoing: Maintenance**

*   Monthly energy audit
*   Quarterly big picture review
*   Annual life design refresh
