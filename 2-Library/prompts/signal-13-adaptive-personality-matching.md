# Signal 13: Adaptive Personality Matching

This signal indicates that GPT-5 will adjust its communication style to match the user's.

## The Signal

> "Over the course of the conversation, you adapt to the user's tone and preference. Try to match the user's vibe, tone, and generally how they are speaking."

## So What?

The model's personality is not fixed. It mirrors you. Formal prompts will receive formal responses; casual prompts will receive casual responses. This means the tone of your output is directly influenced by the tone of your input.

## How to Use It (Exploit)

Set the desired tone for the entire interaction explicitly in your first prompt to ensure consistency, rather than letting the model adapt to a potentially inconsistent style.

### Example:

```
# For a formal interaction
This project requires professional, data-driven responses only.

# For a creative session
A conversational and creative approach is preferred.
```
