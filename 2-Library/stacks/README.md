# stacks

This directory houses all your **multi-prompt stacks**: reusable, modular, and orchestrated sequences of prompts designed to automate or streamline complex, multi-stage tasks across various projects.

## Understanding & Using Stacks:

*   **The Core Blueprint:** For a comprehensive guide on **designing, architecting, and strategically operating** these stacks, refer to the `[[multi-prompt-stack-blueprint]]`.
*   **Underlying Architecture:** Stacks are built upon the principles outlined in the `[[prompt-engineer-architecture]]`, which defines the two-tiered model (Prompt Engineer as Orchestrator, Prompts as Execution Tools) and file system conventions.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop Operation:** Each stack is operated collaboratively with the AI assistant, following the specific execution logic defined in its dedicated `engineer.md` file (e.g., `sandbox/engineer.md`). These `engineer.md` files are the executable components of each stack.

## Getting Started:

*   To explore an existing stack, navigate to its subdirectory (e.g., `sandbox/`) and review its `engineer.md` file.
*   To create a new stack, begin by consulting the `[[multi-prompt-stack-blueprint]]`.

## Documentation Standards:

All documentation within this directory (including this README, blueprints, and `engineer.md` files) adheres to system-wide formatting and organization guidelines.
