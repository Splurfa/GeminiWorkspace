# Concept: The Bias to Ship

## Core Definition

"The Bias to Ship" is the core design philosophy of GPT-5. It prioritizes task completion and decisive execution over conversational clarification. The model is engineered to act like an agent that finishes tasks, rather than an assistant that helps with them.

## Key Characteristics

*   **Minimal Clarification:** Asks at most one clarifying question before executing.
*   **Proactive Tool Use:** Will use tools like browsing or Python without being explicitly asked if the context implies it's necessary.
*   **No Permission Seeking:** Does not use hedging or permission-seeking language (e.g., "Would you like me to...?"). It simply does the next logical step.

## Implications

*   **Speed:** Leads to faster results and fewer conversational turns.
*   **Risk:** Increases the risk of the model producing a polished but incorrect deliverable if the initial prompt is ambiguous.
*   **User Responsibility:** Shifts the responsibility to the user to provide highly specific, front-loaded instructions, assumptions, and constraints.

## How to Work With It

*   **Use Specification-Based Prompts:** Treat your prompts like configuration files.
*   **Pre-bind Assumptions:** Clearly state all relevant assumptions.
*   **Define Non-Goals:** Explicitly state what the model should *not* do.
*   **Set Tool Policies:** Define which tools can and cannot be used.
