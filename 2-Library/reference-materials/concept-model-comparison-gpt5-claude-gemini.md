# Concept: Model Comparison - GPT-5 vs Claude vs Gemini

This note summarizes the different architectural philosophies and ideal use cases for GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini, as described in the "Cracking the Agent Code" article.

## Core Philosophies

Each model expects to be controlled differently:

*   **GPT-5 (Declarative Prompting):** Expects you to be a **manager**. You provide a detailed specification with constraints and assumptions, and it executes the task. Optimizes for **task completion velocity**.

*   **Claude (Collaborative Prompting):** Expects you to be a **collaborator**. You frame a problem, and it helps you think through it via conversation and iteration. Optimizes for **accuracy and thoughtful reasoning**.

*   **Gemini (Structured Prompting):** Expects you to be an **architect**. You provide organized requests, and it provides organized, well-formatted responses. Optimizes for **structured, comprehensive output**.

## When to Use Each Model

### Use GPT-5 for:

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Scaffolding:** When you need functional code or document structures quickly.
*   **Research & Analysis:** When you want a comprehensive answer with data from external tools.
*   **Workflow Automation:** For tasks requiring a sequence of different tools.

### Use Claude for:

*   **Precise Analytical Work:** For complex reasoning where accuracy is paramount.
*   **Code Review & Debugging:** When you need a conservative and methodical technical analysis.
*   **Sensitive Content:** For nuanced topics that require careful handling.

### Use Gemini for:

*   **Structured Documentation:** For reports and presentations that need consistent formatting.
*   **Data Visualization:** When you want charts and tables integrated into the output.
*   **Educational Content:** For teaching materials that benefit from a clear, block-based structure.

## Hybrid Strategy

A powerful workflow can involve using the models sequentially:

1.  **GPT-5:** For rapid ideation and first drafts.
2.  **Claude:** For critical review, refinement, and ensuring accuracy.
3.  **Gemini:** For final formatting and presentation.
